Brain disorders are an umbrella term for a group of neurological and psychiatric conditions that have a major effect on thinking, feeling, and acting. These conditions encompass a wide range of conditions. The illnesses in question pose significant difficulties not only for individuals, but also for healthcare systems all across the world. In this study, we explore the capability of explainable machine learning for classification of people who suffer from brain disorders. This is accomplished by the utilization of brain connection map, also referred as connectome, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In order to analyze features that are based on the connectome, we investigated several different feature selection procedures. These strategies included the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Relief, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), in addition to a logistic regression (LR) classifier. First and foremost, the purpose was to evaluate and contrast the classification accuracy of different feature selection methods in terms of distinguishing healthy controls from diseased individuals. The evaluation of the stability of the traits that were chosen was the second objective. The identification of the regions of the brain that have an effect on the classification was the third main objective. When applied to the UCLA dataset, the LASSO approach, which is our most effective strategy, produced a classification accuracy of 91.85% and a stability index of 0.74, which is greater than the results obtained by other approaches: Relief and ANOVA. These methods are effective in locating trustworthy biomarkers, which adds to the development of connectome-based classification in the context of issues that impact the brain.","[{'text': 'Explainable ML aids brain disorder classification.', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'Connectome derived from fMRI data used.', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'Feature selection methods: LASSO, Relief, ANOVA.', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'LASSO achieved 91.85% accuracy on UCLA dataset.', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'Feature stability and brain region identification crucial.', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'Connectome-based classification finds trustworthy biomarkers.', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'Graph-based learning improves brain disease classification.', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Stability index of LASSO: 0.74.', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'Brain disorders affect thinking, feeling, acting.', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'Significant challenges for global healthcare systems.', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'Neuroimaging requires feature selection for high-dimensional data.', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Multimodal integration enhances diagnostic accuracy.', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}]","[{'text': 'Graph-based learning improves brain disease classification.', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Neuroimaging requires feature selection for high-dimensional data.', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}]","[{'text': 'Explainable ML aids brain disorder classification.', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'Connectome derived from fMRI data used.', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'Feature selection methods: LASSO, Relief, ANOVA.', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'Feature stability and brain region identification crucial.', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'Connectome-based classification finds trustworthy biomarkers.', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'Graph-based learning improves brain disease classification.', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Neuroimaging requires feature selection for high-dimensional data.', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Multimodal integration enhances diagnostic accuracy.', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}]","{'strict_vital_score': 0.14285714285714285, 'strict_all_score': 0.16666666666666666, 'vital_score': 0.5, 'all_score': 0.4166666666666667}"
