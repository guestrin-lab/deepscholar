Here is the paper abstract:\nDesigning expressive yet trainable quantum circuit architectures remains a major challenge for variational quantum algorithms, as manual or heuristic designs often yield suboptimal performance. We propose HyRLQAS (Hybrid-Action Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Architecture Search), a unified framework that integrates discrete gate placement and continuous parameter generation within a hybrid action space. Unlike existing approaches that optimize circuit structure and parameters separately, HyRLQAS jointly learns both topology and initialization while dynamically refining previously placed gates through reinforcement learning. Trained in a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) environment, the agent autonomously constructs circuits that minimize molecular ground-state energy. Experimental results demonstrate that HyRLQAS achieves consistently lower energy errors and more compact circuit structures compared with discrete-only and continuous-only baselines. Furthermore, the hybrid action space yields superior parameter initializations, producing post-optimization energy distributions with consistently lower minima. These findings suggest that hybrid-action reinforcement learning offers a principled pathway toward automated and hardware-efficient quantum circuit design.",
