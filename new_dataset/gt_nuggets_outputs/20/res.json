Here is the paper abstract:\nLanguage models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.",
