Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.","[{'text': 'Graph structures enhance multi-turn instruction following in LLMs', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'GraphIF models dialogues as directed relation graphs', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'GraphIF uses agent-based relation extraction for semantic relations', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'GraphIF converts graph information into natural language prompts', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'GraphIF refines LLM outputs with graph prompts', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'GraphIF improves multi-turn instruction-following metrics', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'Graph structures for multi-turn instruction following are unexplored', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Existing methods use large-scale dialogue datasets for fine-tuning', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Instruction-tuned LLMs struggle with long-distance constraints', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'GraphRAG and LightRAG use graphs for knowledge-enhanced retrieval', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'KGP constructs passage-level graphs for multi-document QA tasks', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'not_support'}]","[{'text': 'Graph structures for multi-turn instruction following are unexplored', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Existing methods use large-scale dialogue datasets for fine-tuning', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}]","[{'text': 'Graph structures for multi-turn instruction following are unexplored', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Existing methods use large-scale dialogue datasets for fine-tuning', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Instruction-tuned LLMs struggle with long-distance constraints', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'GraphRAG and LightRAG use graphs for knowledge-enhanced retrieval', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}]","{'strict_vital_score': 0.14285714285714285, 'strict_all_score': 0.18181818181818182, 'vital_score': 0.14285714285714285, 'all_score': 0.2727272727272727}"
