Here is the paper abstract:\nMolecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution, MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design, laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative human-AI workflows in drug discovery.",
