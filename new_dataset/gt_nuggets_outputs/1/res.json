Here is the paper abstract:\nQuantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration, lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM. cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods, enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis workflows. cubic is openly available at https://github$.$com/alxndrkalinin/cubic",
