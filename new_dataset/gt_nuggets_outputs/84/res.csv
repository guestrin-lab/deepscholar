Accurate and efficient simulations of physical phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are important for scientific and engineering progress. While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yanghuoshan/PEGNet.","[{'text': 'PEGNet integrates PDE dynamics into GNN architecture', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Data-driven methods suffer from error accumulation', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'Physics-embedded approaches improve physical consistency', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'PEGNet evaluated on respiratory airflow and drug delivery', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'PEGNet shows improvements in prediction accuracy', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'GNNs provide framework for learning physical dynamics', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Physics-informed operator networks embed physical constraints', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'Hierarchical GNNs capture multi-scale features', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Physics-Inspired Learning incorporates PDE residuals', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'PINNs use PDE residuals in loss functions', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'DiffPool and TopK pooling for graph compression', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'PEGNet code available on GitHub', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'not_support'}]","[{'text': 'PEGNet integrates PDE dynamics into GNN architecture', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Data-driven methods suffer from error accumulation', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'GNNs provide framework for learning physical dynamics', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Hierarchical GNNs capture multi-scale features', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'PINNs use PDE residuals in loss functions', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'DiffPool and TopK pooling for graph compression', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}]","[{'text': 'PEGNet integrates PDE dynamics into GNN architecture', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Data-driven methods suffer from error accumulation', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Physics-embedded approaches improve physical consistency', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'GNNs provide framework for learning physical dynamics', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Physics-informed operator networks embed physical constraints', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'Hierarchical GNNs capture multi-scale features', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Physics-Inspired Learning incorporates PDE residuals', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'PINNs use PDE residuals in loss functions', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'DiffPool and TopK pooling for graph compression', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}]","{'strict_vital_score': 0.375, 'strict_all_score': 0.46153846153846156, 'vital_score': 0.5, 'all_score': 0.5769230769230769}"
