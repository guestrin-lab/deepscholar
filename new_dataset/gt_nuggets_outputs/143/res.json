  "query": "Write a Related Works section for an academic paper given the paper's abstract. Here is the paper abstract:\nWe introduce theoretically grounded Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann Machines (CSQBMs) that supports continuous-action reinforcement learning. By combining exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann distributions over hidden units, CSQBMs yield a hybrid quantum-classical model that reduces qubit requirements while retaining strong expressiveness. Crucially, gradients with respect to continuous variables can be computed analytically, enabling direct integration into Actor-Critic algorithms. Building on this, we propose a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces global maximization by efficient sampling from the CSQBM distribution, thereby overcoming instability issues in continuous control.",
