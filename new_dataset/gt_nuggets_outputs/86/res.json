  "query": "Write a Related Works section for an academic paper given the paper's abstract. Here is the paper abstract:\nWe introduce FastGraph, a novel GPU-optimized k-nearest neighbor algorithm specifically designed to accelerate graph construction in low-dimensional spaces (2-10 dimensions), critical for high-performance graph neural networks. Our method employs a GPU-resident, bin-partitioned approach with full gradient-flow support and adaptive parameter tuning, significantly enhancing both computational and memory efficiency. Benchmarking demonstrates that FastGraph achieves a 20-40x speedup over state-of-the-art libraries such as FAISS, ANNOY, and SCANN in dimensions less than 10 with virtually no memory overhead. These improvements directly translate into substantial performance gains for GNN-based workflows, particularly benefiting computationally intensive applications in low dimensions such as particle clustering in high-energy physics, visual object tracking, and graph clustering.",
