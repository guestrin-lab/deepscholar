need for predictive maintenance to avoid costly downtime and disastrous
outcomes that could be life-threatening in certain domains. With the growing
popularity of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, machine
learning, and real-time big data analytics, there is a unique opportunity for
efficient predictive maintenance to forecast equipment failures for real-time
intervention and optimize maintenance actions, as traditional reactive and
preventive maintenance practices are often inadequate to meet the requirements
for the industry to provide quality-of-services of operations. Central to this
evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that
continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset
performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such
as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This
paper aims to address this void. We perform a retrospective analysis of the
temporal evolution of the digital twin in predictive maintenance for industrial
engineering to capture the applications, middleware, and technological
requirements that led to the development of the digital twin from its inception
to the AI-enabled digital twin and its self-learning models. We provide a
layered architecture of the digital twin technology, as well as a taxonomy of
the technology-enabled industrial engineering applications systems, middleware,
and the used Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We provide insights into these
systems for the realization of a trustworthy and efficient smart digital-twin
industrial engineering ecosystem. We discuss future research directions in
digital twin for predictive maintenance in industrial engineering.","Several surveys in the literature \cite{18wang2023review, 19zhong2023overview, 20van2022predictive, 21falekas2021digital, ma2024state, 37chen2023advance, mayr2024digital, cimino2024enhancing} emphasize the evolution of DT concepts and their integration with PdM. However, those works do not lay out the architectural elements of DT-PdM, which are necessary for the realization of a Quality-of-Services (QoS), real-time, AI-driven, and secure DT-PdM in a distributed IIoT, edge, and cloud computing integrated system. In addition, most of these studies do not provide a systematic methodology for collecting, including, excluding, and analyzing the relevant papers under study. Table~\ref{tab:table1} summarizes the comparisons across these works, in terms of the requirements considered (e.g., real-time performance, QoS, scalability, security, AI, and energy), search strategies, and the targeted application domains. Unlike earlier reviews, our review paper not only adheres to a systematic methodology but also extends DT-PdM applications beyond traditional settings, enriching it with AI and distributed architectural elements necessary for its efficient realization. We integrate these findings by addressing a
broader spectrum of industrial domains—including marine, automobile, energy, hydro, aviation, railway, and manufacturing industries—and establishes a unified framework for implementing DT-based PdM solutions. Furthermore, our work further integrates its findings by addressing a broader spectrum of industrial domains—including marine, automobile, energy, hydro, aviation, railway, and manufacturing industries—and establishes a unified framework for implementing DT-based PdM solutions. We categorize the related reviews in the literature based on the application domains they target: aviation and aerospace. manufacturing and process equipment, and other specialized domains such as electrical machine \cite{21falekas2021digital}, sheet metal binding \cite{mayr2024digital}, internal supply chain management \cite{cimino2024enhancing}.
% \subsection{Aviation and Aerospace}

Regarding, Aviation and Aerospace, Wang et al. \cite{18wang2023review} provide an in-depth review of DT development specifically for aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) activities, exploring both data-driven digital twin (DDDT) and model-based digital twin (MBDT) for enhanced aircraft system management. Ma et al. \cite{ma2024state} propose a systematic approach aimed at standardizing PdM automation in aviation by explicitly defining informational and functional requirements. Furthermore, Chen et al. \cite{37chen2023advance} showcase a multi-plant production planning platform that leverages simulation-based DT capabilities in aerospace contexts, emphasizing the importance of standardized data frameworks and cloud-edge collaboration.

Regarding Manufacturing and Process equipment, Zhong et al. \cite{19zhong2023overview} critique the limitations of traditional maintenance approaches, advocating for DT-based PdM that incorporates material properties, operating conditions, and degradation laws to enable improved fault prediction and more accurate estimation of remaining useful life. Complementing this perspective, Van Dinter et al. \cite{20van2022predictive} perform a systematic review that categorizes the existing literature along various dimensions such as DT platform implementation, communication protocols, and complexity challenges across manufacturing, energy, aerospace, and marine PdM applications.

In Specialized domains of electrical machines, Falekas and Karlis \cite{21falekas2021digital} focuses on predictive maintenance for electrical machines, highlighting the predominant use of AI techniques and categorizing digital replicas into Digital Model, Digital Shadow, and Digital Twin. Mayr et al. \cite{mayr2024digital} addresses the challenges in sheet metal bending applications by proposing a hybrid approach that integrates both physics-based and data-driven methods. This method uniquely combines DT predictions with production data analysis to derive process parameters that are otherwise difficult to measure directly. Cimino et al. \cite{cimino2024enhancing} introduces a simulation-based DT platform to enhance internal supply chain management in the oil and gas sector. Their modular architecture supports dynamic what-if analyses, resulting in notable improvements in system flow time and tardiness reduction.
