2510.06919v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06919v1,2025-10-08 11:52:39+00:00,Bayesian Nonparametric Dynamical Clustering of Time Series,"We present a method that models the evolution of an unbounded number of time
series clusters by switching among an unknown number of regimes with linear
dynamics. We develop a Bayesian non-parametric approach using a hierarchical
Dirichlet process as a prior on the parameters of a Switching Linear Dynamical
System and a Gaussian process prior to model the statistical variations in
amplitude and temporal alignment within each cluster. By modeling the evolution
of time series patterns, the method avoids unnecessary proliferation of
clusters in a principled manner. We perform inference by formulating a
variational lower bound for off-line and on-line scenarios, enabling efficient
learning through optimization. We illustrate the versatility and effectiveness
of the approach through several case studies of electrocardiogram analysis
using publicly available databases.","\label{sec:related_work}
Probabilistic approaches to clustering time-series data have been widely explored, particularly through mixture models \cite{smyth1996, biernacki2000, zhong2003, bach2004}. These methods assume that the data is generated by a mixture of distributions with predefined forms, such as Gaussian, HMMs, or graphical models. With the aim of reducing the strong modeling assumptions, a nonparametric approach is proposed by \cite{kahlegi2016} in exchange for assuming stationary ergodicity over the data distribution. While effective for static data, these methods often fail to account for the evolving nature of time series, where distributional shifts can reduce precision, and where a fixed number of clusters is not flexible enough to deal with the emergence of new clusters. Trying to reduce this variability between observations, alignment based on GPs is developed in \cite{kazlauskaite_2019}, resulting in better clustering within the latent space. Also, works such as \cite{chiu2022, kolter2007} address this variability by detecting and reacting to concept drift. In contrast, the present approach integrates this dynamic transformation directly into the model, enabling clusters to adapt independently while parameterizing the evolving distributions over time.

Bayesian nonparametrics have provided a natural solution to overcome the limitation of fixed cardinality for the state space. In \cite{qi2007}, authors propose a HDP-HMM model for clustering fixed-length segments of a time series, with applications to music analysis. In \cite{chakraborty2023}, an infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) on a
state space of multi-dimensional vector fields described by GPs is proposed to extract traffic patterns from multi-vehicle trajectories. In \cite{fox_2011}, HDP-SLDS has proven effective for modeling temporal dynamics in time-series data, with applications to segmentation of dancing honey bee trajectories and learning changes in the volatility of the IBOVESPA stock exchange. A sticky version of the original model increases the expected probability of self-transition, thus avoiding unrealistic fast changes between linear regimes caused by the intrinsic variability of raw data. The present proposal avoids this problem through pattern abstraction on the time-series data, and therefore the segmentation is performed using time-series segments as samples, increasing the stability of the required dynamics. 
    
Procedures for efficient learning of nonlinear state-space models and nonlinear mappings from latent states to observations have been proposed in \cite{damianou11, frigola14}, by placing proper GP priors. These methods exhibit good performance in applications such as reconstructing human motion capture data and high-dimensional video sequences, but they need more complex non-conjugate inference and learning algorithms. Notably, in \cite{alvarez09} the latent force model is introduced as a combination of mechanistic modeling principles with non-parametric data-driven components, using GPs as nonparametric models for unknown input functions in physical models, which are formulated as ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Applications in modeling human motion capture data, describing the time-dependent expression levels of genes, and predicting heavy metal concentrations in geostatistics show the versatility of the proposal.
\cite{hensman2015} proposed a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Process (DP-GP) model for clustering structured time-series data, effectively capturing both intra-group and inter-group variability. However, their approach focuses on clustering from a static perspective, without explicitly addressing the temporal dynamics underlying the time-series data.
Importantly, an extension to nonlinear (ODEs) and significant improvement in computational complexity for latent force modeling has been achieved in \cite{hartikainen2011, hartikainen2012}. However, their application to dynamic clustering with nonlinear mappings to observations given by GP priors faces identifiability and scalability issues due to the nested dependencies over complex GP structures.","Probabilistic approaches to clustering time-series data have been widely explored, particularly through mixture models \cite{smyth1996, biernacki2000, zhong2003, bach2004}.
