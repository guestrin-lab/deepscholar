AI/ML. However, the range of potential protein sequences and structures is
astronomically vast, even for moderately sized proteins. Hence, achieving
convergence between generated and predicted structures demands substantial
computational resources for sampling. The Integrated Machine-learning for
Protein Structures at Scale (IMPRESS) offers methods and advanced computing
systems for coupling AI to high-performance computing tasks, enabling the
ability to evaluate the effectiveness of protein designs as they are developed,
as well as the models and simulations used to generate data and train models.
This paper introduces IMPRESS and demonstrates the development and
implementation of an adaptive protein design protocol and its supporting
computing infrastructure. This leads to increased consistency in the quality of
protein design and enhanced throughput of protein design due to dynamic
resource allocation and asynchronous workload execution.","With the advent of deep learning models that enable high-level insight into protein sequence and structure, several other advances have been made in developing genetic algorithms for design generation.

The recently proposed EvoPro protocol achieves this through iterative runs of sequence generation—using either ProteinMPNN or random mutagenesis—and AlphaFold, which employs single-sequence structure prediction mode to accelerate inference\cite{gnkrk23}. 
EvoPro shows significant advancements in coupling deep learning models for efficient sequence space exploration but faces two limitations. Eliminating MSA generation restricts EvoPro to designing binders of a specific size\cite{apco21}. As the designed domain increases in complexity, AlphaFold2 needs to utilize evolutionary information to ensure an accurately predicted structure\cite{e23}. Furthermore, AlphaFold2 is a powerful classifier, distinguishing between high- and low-quality binders\cite{mdbabb23,dcso24}. Allowing AlphaFold2 to utilize evolutionary information in its constructed MSA improves its predictive abilities and directs IMPRESS toward effectively guiding design exploration for more potent binders.

The newly developed MProt-DPO protocol is another technique that enables efficient exploration of the protein design landscape \cite{dhbo24}. Sequences are generated with a protein LLM, then ranked and sorted into preference pairs to fine-tune the original model \cite{laro23}\cite{rsmo24}.

MProt-DPO achieves remarkable efficiency but is restricted to purely sequence-based models. Therefore, design generation is never directly conditioned on the protein structure, but must rely on downstream MD simulations.

The IMPRESS framework allows any sequence generation method to be plugged into the design pipeline, enabling both LLMs and graph-based models to fully exploit the rich functional information available in protein structures.","With the advent of deep learning models that enable high-level insight into protein sequence and structure, several other advances have been made in developing genetic algorithms for design generation.
