boundaries, making effective governance essential. Usage control policies have
emerged as a key paradigm for regulating data usage, safeguarding privacy,
protecting intellectual property, and ensuring compliance with regulations. A
central mechanism for usage control is the handling of obligations, which arise
as a side effect of using and sharing data. Effective monitoring of obligations
requires capturing usage traces and accounting for temporal aspects such as
start times and deadlines, as obligations may evolve over times into different
states, such as fulfilled, violated, or expired. While several solutions have
been proposed for obligation monitoring, they often lack formal semantics or
provide limited support for reasoning over obligation states. To address these
limitations, we extend GUCON, a policy framework grounded in the formal
semantics of SPAQRL graph patterns, to explicitly model the temporal aspects of
an obligation. This extension enables the expressing of temporal obligations
and supports continuous monitoring of their evolving states based on usage
traces stored in temporal knowledge graphs. We demonstrate how this extended
model can be represented using RDF-star and SPARQL-star and propose an
Obligation State Manager that monitors obligation states and assess their
compliance with respect to usage traces. Finally, we evaluate both the extended
model and its prototype implementation.","\label{sec:relatedwork}

%different solution regarding usage control
%Several solutions have been proposed to address usage control and in particular obligation monitoring. 
%SW/ Usage Control Focused/ Standards
% Usage Control field
There are several works that focus on usage control in general and obligation monitoring in particular. UCON \cite{Sandhu2004} is an abstract model that extends access control with the concepts of obligations, decision continuity and attribute mutability. 
Although several formalisms have been suggested for UCON, and attempts have been made to include it in standard representation languages \cite{LAZOUSKI201081, Maurizio2010}, there is currently no established reference or standard policy specification and implementation for UCON. As a result, UCON has not gained widespread adoption in industry.
Another language, OSL, formalized in Z \cite{Hilty2007}, is utilized to express conditional prohibitions and obligations. Although one can express temporal constraints using OSL, the obligations in OSL do not support the notion of obligation states. Additionally, it is unclear how said obligations should be enforced.

% SW
In the Semantic Web community, several general policy languages and frameworks have been proposed, including Protune \cite{protune2010}, Rei \cite{Kagal2002}, Ponder \cite{Damianou2001},  KAoS \cite{Uszok2003}, and the DSA policy framework \cite{10.1007/978-3-030-62466-8_30}. Protune focuses on access control and trust management, but lacks support for expressing obligations. While, Rei, Ponder, KAoS, and the DSA framework can express obligations, their design lacks the states of obligations, which limits their ability to monitor obligation lifecycles. Furthermore, it remains unclear how obligations expressed in these languages are enforced in practice. Additionally, Ponder lacks formal semantics, which limits its applicability in policy reasoning.

% Standards
%ODRl and both implementations ..

In terms of policy standards, ODRL\footnote{ODRL, \url{https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/}} is a W3C recommendation that provides a model and vocabulary for describing policies, including obligations. Although ODRL does not have yet an official formal semantics, several efforts have attempted to formalize it, either by using web ontologies \cite{GarcaFormalisingOS} or by defining operational semantics through rule-based reasoning \cite{Fornara2018, Steyskal2015TowardsFS}.
Notably, \citet{Fornara2019} focused on enriching ODRL by extending the model with the notions of permission and obligation states. The operational semantics of this extended model are implemented using a production rule system. 
Our extended GUCON model builds upon the obligation states formally defined by \citet{Fornara2019}. However, we simplify the GUCON model by including only temporal metaproperties and define the formal semantics of obligation states separately.
Currently, a W3C group\footnote{ODRL Formal Semantics, \url{https://w3c.github.io/odrl/formal-semantics/}} is working on defining the formal semantics of ODRL; which is currently only described informally in plain English, without any formal specification.
\citet{Cimmino2025} highlight several limitations of ODRL. Although ODRL supports expressing various types of constraints; such as temporal and spatial constraints; they lack formal semantics. In particular, it remains unclear how to reason effectively about obligation start times and deadlines. Furthermore, ODRL does not incorporate the notion of the state of affairs, which complicates the enforcement and/ or policy re-evaluation whenever the policy or context changes.
In contrast, the state of the affairs, represented as a KB, is a fundamental component of our GUCON framework. GUCON also leverages graph patterns, enabling straightforward and dynamic policy re-evaluation against the current state of the world.
SHACL is another standard that has been explored for expressing policies. \citet{robaldo2023compliance} propose using SHACL to represent norms and leveraging SHACL implementations for compliance checking. However, it remains unclear how these implementations can be used to reason over the states of obligations. 
Another widely adopted standard is the XACML policy language and framework \cite{XACML2013}, originally developed for managing access control policies. Several studies have extended XACML with UCON capabilities \cite{10.1007/978-1-4419-6794-7_11,kateb2014}. Another related standard is the Abbreviated Language for Authorization (ALFA)\footnote{ALFA, \url{https://alfa.guide/}}, a domain-specific language for specifying authorization policies. However, both XACML (including its extensions) and ALFA lack formal foundations.
For a more in-depth analysis of the state of the art in usage control solutions, the survey in \cite{AKAICHI2025100698} offers a comprehensive overview of the existing gaps in this field.
