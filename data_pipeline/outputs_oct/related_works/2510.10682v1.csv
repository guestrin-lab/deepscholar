crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.","\subsection{Online Action Detection}
Online Action Detection (OAD) requires identifying and classifying actions instantly, without access to future frames. Contemporary OAD methods frequently center on memory modeling to capture and leverage historical context from observed frames. Early methods primarily relied on RNN or CNN based models (e.g., \cite{deo2017learning}) to capture historical context. TRN proposed by Xu et al.\cite{xu2019temporal} explicitly modeled past frames and their temporal context, while Eun et al. \cite{eun2020learning} extended GRU \cite{cho2014learning} with a discriminative embedding model to more effectively learn representations for detecting ongoing actions. Zhao et al.\cite{zhao2022progressive} further improved learning efficiency through knowledge distillation to mitigate inconsistent visual content.

With the success of Transformers \cite{vaswani2017attention} in modeling temporal sequences, recent approaches have explored attention-based architectures. Wang et al.\cite{wang2021oadtr}, proposed an encoder-decoder framework, referred to as OadTR, to jointly encode historical information and predict future actions. LSTR proposed by Xu et al.\cite{xu2021long} expanded the memory horizon by introducing segmented memory to analyze historical context in depth. Yang et al. \cite{yang2022colar} adopted exemplary frames to guide attention scheme learning representation sothat the detection accuracy is improved. Chen et al. \cite{chen2022gatehub} introduced a gated history unit and a future-augmented background suppression strategy to better capture temporal cues. Despite these advances, OAD still faces the inherent limitation of observed information, which can reduce the effectiveness of modeling. On the other hand, current  popular methods exploit transformer's capacity for memory modeling, but the ever-growing length of the memory sequence limits the effectiveness of these methods. For the limitation of observed information, our proposed SSM employs cross-temporal interactions to facilitate richer temporal information learning. Moreover, by focusing on state-based action dynamics, our method alleviates the limitations brought by the ever-growing length of memory sequences.
\subsection{Online Action Anticipation}
Online action anticipation has received significant attention in recent years, with its primary goal being the prediction of future actions based solely on observations. Early works predominantly employed recurrent neural networks. For instance, Furnari and Farinella \cite{furnari2020rolling} utilize a Dual-LSTM structure to encode and distill input sequences, generating cyclic predictions for future frames. Their framework additionally incorporated a learnable attention module to fuse representations from RGB, optical flow, and object-centric streams, thereby capturing a wide range of visual cues. Similarly, Qi et al. \cite{qi2021self}  tackle error accumulation in recurrent models by combining a contrastive loss with an attention mechanism, iteratively refining intermediate feature embeddings. They also introduce verb and noun classification for auxiliary guidance. Subsequently, Liu and Lam \cite{liu2022hybrid} enhance the recurrent pipeline with an external memory bank and a classification loss for observed content, while employing contrastive learning to more closely align anticipated features with ground-truth sequences. 

Moving beyond recurrent networks, recent work has embraced Transformer architectures for action anticipation. Girdhar and Grauman \cite{girdhar2021anticipative} developed the Anticipative Video Transformer (AVT), combining a Transformer encoder on raw video frames with a masked decoder to jointly predict intermediate and final representations. Osman et al. \cite{osman2021slowfast} took inspiration from action recognition and devised a dual-stream approach with different frame sampling rates, aiming to capture both slow and fast dynamics in videos. Meanwhile, Roy et al. \cite{roy2024interaction} focused on human-object interactions, showing that modeling object-specific cues through attention or Transformer modules can effectively reveal which items are likely to be involved in upcoming activities. Most of the previous works have tended to focus solely on the single-task setting of action anticipation, overlooking a key aspect: The outcomes of online action detection and action anticipation mutually influence each other. Consequently, they miss the potential benefit of integrating complementary features from both tasks. Such complementarity may yield richer and more robust feature representations, which have the potential to guide the model to produce more accurate detection and anticipation results. Building on this insight, Our SSM addresses this limitation by enabling joint training or inference for both tasks simultaneously.

A. Online Action Detection
Online Action Detection (OAD) requires identifying and
classifying actions instantly, without access to future frames.
Contemporary OAD methods frequently center on memory
modeling to capture and leverage historical context from
observed frames. Early methods primarily relied on RNN or
CNN based models (e.g., [16]) to capture historical context.
TRN proposed by Xu et al. [17] explicitly modeled past frames
and their temporal context, while Eun et al. [18] extended
GRU [19] with a discriminative embedding model to more
effectively learn representations for detecting ongoing actions.
Zhao et al. [20] further improved learning efficiency through
knowledge distillation to mitigate inconsistent visual content.
With the success of Transformers [21] in modeling temporal
sequences, recent approaches have explored attention-based
architectures. Wang et al. [22], proposed an encoder-decoder
framework, referred to as OadTR, to jointly encode historical
information and predict future actions. LSTR proposed by
Xu et al. [9] expanded the memory horizon by introducing
segmented memory to analyze historical context in depth.
Yang et al. [23] adopted exemplary frames to guide attention
scheme learning representation sothat the detection accuracy
is improved. Chen et al. [10] introduced a gated history unit
and a future-augmented background suppression strategy to
better capture temporal cues. Despite these advances, OAD
still faces the inherent limitation of observed information,
which can reduce the effectiveness of modeling. On the other
hand, current popular methods exploit transformer’s capacity
for memory modeling, but the ever-growing length of the
memory sequence limits the effectiveness of these methods.
For the limitation of observed information, our proposed
SSM employs cross-temporal interactions to facilitate richer
temporal information learning. Moreover, by focusing on state-
based action dynamics, our method alleviates the limitations
brought by the ever-growing length of memory sequences.
B. Online Action Anticipation
Online action anticipation has received significant attention
in recent years, with its primary goal being the prediction of
future actions based solely on observations. Early works pre-
dominantly employed recurrent neural networks. For instance,
Furnari and Farinella [24] utilize a Dual-LSTM structure to en-
code and distill input sequences, generating cyclic predictions
for future frames. Their framework additionally incorporated a

learnable attention module to fuse representations from RGB,
optical flow, and object-centric streams, thereby capturing a
wide range of visual cues. Similarly, Qi et al. [25] tackle
error accumulation in recurrent models by combining a con-
trastive loss with an attention mechanism, iteratively refining
intermediate feature embeddings. They also introduce verb and
noun classification for auxiliary guidance. Subsequently, Liu
and Lam [26] enhance the recurrent pipeline with an external
memory bank and a classification loss for observed content,
while employing contrastive learning to more closely align
anticipated features with ground-truth sequences.
Moving beyond recurrent networks, recent work has em-
braced Transformer architectures for action anticipation. Gird-
har and Grauman [12] developed the Anticipative Video Trans-
former (A VT), combining a Transformer encoder on raw video
frames with a masked decoder to jointly predict intermediate
and final representations. Osman et al. [27] took inspiration
from action recognition and devised a dual-stream approach
with different frame sampling rates, aiming to capture both
slow and fast dynamics in videos. Meanwhile, Roy et al. [28]
focused on human-object interactions, showing that modeling
object-specific cues through attention or Transformer modules
can effectively reveal which items are likely to be involved in
upcoming activities. Most of the previous works have tended
to focus solely on the single-task setting of action anticipation,
overlooking a key aspect: The outcomes of online action
detection and action anticipation mutually influence each other.
Consequently, they miss the potential benefit of integrating
complementary features from both tasks. Such complementar-
ity may yield richer and more robust feature representations,
which have the potential to guide the model to produce more
accurate detection and anticipation results. Building on this
insight, Our SSM addresses this limitation by enabling joint
training or inference for both tasks simultaneously.
