particularly in price-sensitive markets. System and vendor applications that
come pre-installed on budget Android devices frequently operate with elevated
privileges, yet they receive limited independent examination. To address this
gap, we developed a framework that extracts APKs from physical devices and
applies static analysis to identify privacy and security issues in embedded
software. Our study examined 1,544 APKs collected from seven African
smartphones. The analysis revealed that 145 applications (9%) disclose
sensitive data, 249 (16%) expose critical components without sufficient
safeguards, and many present additional risks: 226 execute privileged or
dangerous commands, 79 interact with SMS messages (read, send, or delete), and
33 perform silent installation operations. We also uncovered a vendor-supplied
package that appears to transmit device identifiers and location details to an
external third party. These results demonstrate that pre-installed applications
on widely distributed low-cost devices represent a significant and
underexplored threat to user security and privacy.","\label{related}

Zheng et al.~\cite{10.1145/2590296.2590313} presented a tool named DroidRay that extracts statically and dynamically pre-installed apps from 250 firmware downloaded from forums and website. 
The static extraction consists of extracting pre-installed apps directly from the firmware images. As for the dynamic extraction, it consists of flashing the image into a device and then extracting the pre-installed apps using ADB commands.
DroidRay performs pre-installed app analysis and system analysis.
For the pre-installed app analysis,  they extracted the “SharedUserId” attribute from the AndroidManifest.xml and the signature information from the RSA file. Then, they compare them with the default signatures they found from the AOSP. They also analyzed the apps in VirusTotal do detect potential malware, and applied a filter to retain apps having dangerous permissions or silent installation behavior.
For the system analysis, DroidRay performs static and dynamic analysis of the Android firmware by doing a system signature vulnerability detection, a network security analysis, and a privilege escalation vulnerability detection. 
In our proposed pipeline, we leveraged the technique of dynamic extraction to directly extract pre-installed apps from a physical device using ADB commands rather than collecting firmware and flashing them into a device.
We also used the same technique concerning malware detection, consisting of analysing APK files in VirusTotal.

Mitchell et al.~\cite{10.1145/2557547.2557557} designed DexDiff, a system for assessing the security impacts of vendor customization to the official Android system.
DexDiff helps the security analyst, who first retrieves the pre-installed apps and libraries from the phone and then builds their corresponding base binaries from the release branch in AOSP on which the phone is based.  
DexDiff compares each pair of these binaries obtained and evaluates the security impacts of individual modifications.
The bit and only similarity that this study has compared to our approach is that it extracts pre-installed apps from the phone. However, the proposed tool did not automate this process. The apps are supposed to be extracted before using DexDiff.
Contrary to our approach, PiPLAnD automated the process of extraction and analysis.


Elsabagh et al.~\cite{251554} proposed a static analysis tool named FIRMSCOPE, to identify unwanted functionality in pre-installed apps by analyzing the Android firmware.
FIRMSCOPE extracts pre-installed apps from the Android firmware and then performs a taint analysis with context-sensitive, flow-sensitive, field-sensitive, and partially object-sensitive.
Specifically, it focuses exclusively on identifying the increase in privileges. 


Gamba et al.~\cite{9152633}  presented a large-scale study of Android pre-installed using crowd-sourcing methods.
In this study, the authors built an Android app, Firmware Scanner, that looks for and extracts pre-installed apps when installed on a device.
This study performs permission analysis using Androguard~\cite{desnos2011androguard}, static analysis leveraging existing tools such as Androwarn, FlowDroid~\cite{10.1145/2594291.2594299}, and Amandroid~\cite{wei2018amandroid}, as well as apktool~\cite{apktool} and Androguard frameworks to identify unwanted behaviors, and traffic analysis using the crowd-sourced Lumen mobile traffic dataset to see app real-world behaviors. 
Compared to this work, we did the same by extracting pre-installed apps from the physical device but using ADB commands rather than an installed app, and we also performed a taint analysis using FlowDroid.

Bl\'azquez et al.~\cite{9519485} proposed FOTA (Firmware-Over-The-Air) Finder to automatically classify a given APK as FOTA or not based on Androguard, using the dataset of pre-installed apps from Firmware Scanner~\cite{9152633}. 
Then, they performed behavior analysis relying on FlowDroid and Amandroid for a taint analysis and a modification of Androwarn~\cite{androwarn} to analyze the use of API calls.
This part of the work is a bit similar to our data leak detection using FlowDroid. However, we considered all the pre-installed apps extracted from devices, and performed also malware detection.

Hou et al.~\cite{9793923} performed a study in which they collected firmware images from vendors, official websites and open source repositories, and CVE data to link them with pre-installed apps. 
In this study, they proposed a tool named AndScanner that automates the extraction of pre-installed apps from firmware images before analyzing them.
AndScanner proposes an analysis of the security patches of the firmware to know if it has been patched in time and if the security issues have been fixed. 
It also performs app analysis by analyzing the pre-installed apps using Androguard to identify misconfiguration in the manifest file and CryptoGuard~\cite{CryptoGuardOSS} to detect cryptography misuses.
Our study is completely different since we did not focus on analyzing the manifest files and cryptography misuses. However, we leveraged on Androguard framework in our pipeline.

More recently, Sutter and Tellenbach~\cite{FirmwareDroid} proposed FirmwareDroid, an automated static analysis tool for pre-installed apps.
This tool automates the process of extracting pre-installed apps from firmware images and their analysis using existing tools including Androgurad and Exodus.
The study identifies the advertising tracker libraries used with Exodus and the permissions pre-installed apps inherited with Androguard.
The authors have integrated 8 open source static analysis tools in FirmwareDroid which could be used for more analysis.

Almost all of these studies are a bit similar since they follow almost the same approach, such as collecting firmware from the Internet, extracting the pre-installed apps, and analyzing them.
Our approach allows the extraction of pre-installed apps from physical devices, the detection of malware and dangerous permissions, the detection of data leakage, and the use of malicious URLs in pre-installed apps. 
Furthermore, our approach is particularly tested on low-cost devices sold in Africa.
However, with this approach, every brand and every Android device can be inspected and analyzed. Consequently, we do not have a limitation related to missing some brands or firmware.
