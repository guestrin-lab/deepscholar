2510.05650v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05650v1,2025-10-07 07:58:32+00:00,EduVerse: A User-Defined Multi-Agent Simulation Space for Education Scenario,"Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.","\label{sec:related-work}

\textbf{EduVerse} aims to build a user-defined multi-agent simulation space for education that systematically supports cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution in virtual classrooms. Despite progress in educational agents, multi-agent simulation, and LLM-based generation, a unified platform integrating these dimensions remains absent. We therefore review three threads closely aligned with EduVerse’s dimensions (see App.~\ref{sec:more-relate-work} for details).

\textbf{Educational agents and virtual classrooms.}
Early systems such as \textit{Cognitive Tutor} \citep{Anderson01041995} and \textit{SimStudent} \citep{article} focused on skill acquisition and personalization, typically via rule- or model-based mechanisms \citep{christensen2011simschool, foley2005making, carrington2011enhancing, dotger2010medicine}. Teacher-training simulations used scripted virtual students as scaffolds but lacked adaptivity to feedback, peer influence, or classroom context \citep{kervin2006classsim, dieker2015tle, delamarre2021interactive, shernoff2018early, kelleci2021using}. Recent generative extensions enable task-level learning \citep{zhang_simulating_2024, lee_generative_nodate, yue_mathvc_2025, mollick_ai_2024, markel_gpteach_2023, wang_generative_2025, fahid_online_2024}, but often omit emotional modeling, stylistic progression, and multi-agent coupling, limiting their suitability for open, dynamic classrooms.


\textbf{Multi-agent social simulations.}
Works such as \textit{Generative Agents} show that LLMs enhanced with memory, planning, and reflection can generate human-like social behaviors in sandbox settings \citep{park2023generative, li2023camelcommunicativeagentsmind, chen2023agentversefacilitatingmultiagentcollaboration, jinxin_cgmi_2023}. However, these focus on adult roles and informal contexts, overlooking classroom-specific structures such as IRF discourse, teacher–student roles, and goal alignment. They also lack mechanisms for knowledge progression tracking and temporal adaptivity.

\textbf{Personalized modeling and long-term coherence.}
Persona conditioning and style control are widely used to maintain role consistency \citep{shao_character-llm_2023, jiang2024personallminvestigatingabilitylarge, wang2024rolellmbenchmarkingelicitingenhancing}, with design patterns surveyed by \citet{tseng-etal-2024-two}. Yet long-term interactions often suffer from persona drift, leading to memory-based prompting \citep{zhong2023memorybankenhancinglargelanguage}, style constraints \citep{roy2023conversationstyletransferusing}, and metacognitive or reflective mechanisms \citep{madaan2023selfrefineiterativerefinementselffeedback, li_exploring_2025, didolkar2024metacognitivecapabilitiesllmsexploration}. Research on continual and lifelong learning also contributes to longitudinal coherence \citep{wang2024comprehensivesurveycontinuallearning, parisi_continual_2019, zheng2024lifelonglearninglargelanguage, chen_lifelong_nodate, zheng2025lifelonglearninglargelanguage, maharana2024evaluatinglongtermconversationalmemory, wang2025recursivelysummarizingenableslongterm, tan2025prospectretrospectreflectivememory, li2025helloagainllmpoweredpersonalized}. However, these methods are mostly evaluated in single-agent or non-classroom contexts, rarely integrating group-level structures or pedagogically grounded evolution. \textit{EduAgent} \citep{xu_eduagent_2024} models individual cognitive and metacognitive processes but lacks multi-agent coordination and group dynamics.

Overall, Prior work offers key ingredients—feedback, generative behavior, and role consistency—but remains fragmented across time spans (short-term vs. longitudinal), modeling dimensions (individual vs. group), and educational contexts (informal vs. classroom-structured). \textbf{EduVerse} bridges these gaps by combining user-defined environments, agent, sessions and by adopting the \textbf{CIE} architecture to unify individual coherence, group dynamics, and cross-session evolution in a scalable and interpretable classroom simulation platform.","\textbf{EduVerse} aims to build a user-defined multi-agent simulation space for education that systematically supports cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution in virtual classrooms.
