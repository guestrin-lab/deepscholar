quality and realism perception of Digital Twins (DT) with varying levels of
fidelity in Virtual Reality (VR). In a mixed experimental design, 24
participants were divided into two equal groups: an exposure group, in which
members were shown physical objects before inspecting and rating their replicas
in VR, and a control group without prior knowledge. Three objects were
presented, each under four fidelity conditions with varying texture resolution
and geometric detail. Participants rated perceived quality and realism through
in-VR self-reports. Statistical analysis revealed that texture resolution
significantly affected realism and quality perception, whereas geometric detail
only influenced quality ratings. Investigating the between-factor, no
significant effect of exposure on quality and realism perception was found.
These findings raise important questions about the cognitive relationship
between physical objects and their digital counterparts and how fidelity
influences the perception of DTs in VR.","\paragraph{\textbf{Concepts}}
%% Concepts Fidelity, visual realism and photorealism and how to measure
In computer graphics, fidelity, visual realism, and photorealism are regarded as similar concepts \cite{Fan2018}. According to Ferwerda, an image is photorealistic if it produces the same visual response as looking at a scene in the analog world \cite{Ferwerda2003}. In the context of simulation, the term fidelity goes back to Gerathewohl, who defined it as ""the degree to which a device accurately produces a specific effect"". \cite{gerathewohl1969fidelity}. In Mixed Reality (MR), Milgram and Kishino defined the term Reproduction Fidelity as ""the quality with which the synthesizing display is able to reproduce the actual or intended images of the objects being displayed"" \cite{Milgram1994}. McMahan later made a distinction between display fidelity (reproduction of real-world sensory stimuli) and interaction fidelity (reproduction of real-world interactions) \cite{mcmahan2012}. In a recent publication, Bonfert et al. present a comprehensive taxonomy differentiating between eight types of fidelity \cite{bonfert2025}. The term visual realism is often used in a similar context. Slater et al. distinguish visual realism between geometric realism (geometric fidelity) and illumination realism (lightning fidelity) \cite{Slater2009a}. Visual realism, however, is regarded as an objective descriptor, similar to fidelity, in contrast to perceived realism, which is regarded as the subjective judgment of realism \cite{Weber2021}. Another related subjective concept is the concept of presence in virtual or simulated environments. Articulated by Slater as a combination of place illusion (the sense of being there) and plausibility illusion (the sense that what is happening is real) \cite{Slater2009b}. Despite a conceptual relationship, higher visual realism does not necessarily lead to a greater sense of presence \cite{JungLindeman2021}. However, perceived realism was proposed as one part of a two-dimensional construct of presence together with ""being there"" \cite{Weber2021}. Finally, Gonçalves et al. proposed a new theoretical model using the term subjective realism, which they clearly distinguish from objective realism \cite{goncalves2025}. In their model, they also draw a connection to presence. Quality or experienced quality in the context of immersive media is defined as ""a result of a comparison and judgment process, in which the perceived quality features, resulting from a perception and reflection process triggered by a physical signal, are compared to the desired quality features underlying the user’s expectations""\cite{perkisQUALINETWhitePaper2020a}. Visual realism and quality are interconnected, and Fan et al. referred to the quality evaluation of computer graphics as part of predicting visual realism \cite{Fan2018}. In this research, we treat realism and quality as subjective factors, referring to them as perceived realism and perceived quality throughout, while the objective properties of the virtual world are described in terms of fidelity. The distinction between realism and quality perception is that high-quality visuals do not necessarily have to be realistic (e.g., stylized graphics, fantastic worlds).

%% measurments
\paragraph{\textbf{Measurements}}
To measure perceived realism, researchers mostly rely on subjective measurements through self-reports, sometimes supported by complementary physiological measurements \cite{Goncalves2021}. Schmied-Kowartzki et al. proposed the Visual Realism Classification Scale (VRCS), a comprehensive scale for measuring the visual realism of 3D models in MR, distinguishing between the factors of Lighting, Reflection, Texture, Structure, Form, and Internal Consistency \cite{SchmiedKowarzik2024}. Most commonly, perceived realism is assessed as part of the Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ), a standardized questionnaire for measuring presence, as it is one of its sub-scales \cite{ipq, Goncalves2021}. Quality ratings have separate methodologies from the field of computer vision \cite{vanhoey2017}. Nehmé et al. compared three subjective methods from the field of image processing and applied them to the quality assessment of 3D graphics in VR: Category Rating with Hidden Reference (ACR-HR), Double Stimulus Impairment Scale (DSIS), and Subjective Assessment Methodology for Video Quality (SAMVIQ) \cite{Nehmé2021}. Their findings suggest that DSIS, in which participants are exposed to two 3D models side by side and asked to rate the quality degradation, yielded the most promising results. As fidelity is objective, it can only be measured through objective assessment. One approach is an add-on for the 3D software Blender, developed to generate a level of detail (LOD) score for 3D scenes that distinguishes between geometric and texture fidelity \cite{rodriguezgarcia2025}.

%% User studies
\paragraph{\textbf{User Studies}}
While there is a lack of research on the relationship between fidelity and strictly perceived realism, several studies have explored the relationship between 3D object fidelity and other user experience metrics, predominantly presence. Hvass et al. conducted a study using a video game as a stimulus and tested it with varying degrees of geometric and texture fidelity \cite{Hvass2017}. The results of self-reports and physiological measurements showed that participants rated a higher sense of presence and fear responses in scenes with higher visual realism. Gutiérrez et al. assessed the quality metrics for 3D models under different lightning conditions in MR \cite{Gutiérrez2020}. The models were presented with varying levels of geometry and texture and rated through an overall quality estimation. The findings showed that brighter light is a factor for increased quality ratings. Brade et al. explored how solid colored ""CAD-style"" objects would compare to fully texturized models in a VR assembly task \cite{Brade2021}. While high-fidelity machines created a significantly higher sense of presence, plain models scored sufficiently well to be considered as an option for lower development costs. Braga et al. explored how the visual fidelity of virtual food items influences users’ perceived realism, task motivation, engagement, and interest \cite{braga2025}. They reported that visual fidelity itself did not affect the assessed metrics. However, a relationship was found between perceived realism, task motivation, engagement and interest. Braga et al. argued that, instead of visual fidelity, the typicality of the experience and plausibility may play prominent roles in shaping the user's perception. Skarbez et al. were among the first to investigate how users perceive virtual replicas of physical spaces \cite{skarbez022}. They conducted three studies manipulating the scale of the replicated room and furniture, removing elements from the scene, and altering lighting conditions. Their findings indicate that the scale of the room and furniture significantly influenced perceived realism, whereas lighting had a minimal impact. Lastly, a study by Rzepka et al. explored the effect of object knowledge, specifically the size of well-known objects (e.g., Rubik's Cube), on VR visual perception \cite{rzepka2023}. Participants were shown multiple virtual objects in varying sizes and distances via a VR headset. Their findings indicate that participants tended to rely on familiar object sizes despite what was displayed in VR. Despite the variety of studies, no previous work has explicitly tested the present metrics. However, the findings highlight that user perception is shaped by a combination of objective properties of the VR and cognitive or contextual factors.","\paragraph{\textbf{Concepts}}
