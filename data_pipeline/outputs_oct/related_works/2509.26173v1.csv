crucial to model and predict the long-term dynamics and sustainability of Open
Source Software (OSS) communities. To this end, we analyze temporal activity
patterns of developers, revealing an inherently ``bursty'' nature of commit
contributions. To investigate the social mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we
adopt a network-based modelling framework that captures developer interactions
through co-editing networks. Our framework models social interactions, where a
developer editing the code of other developers triggers accelerated activity
among collaborators. Using a large data set on 50 major OSS communities, we
further develop a method that identifies activity cascades, i.e. the
propagation of developer activity in the underlying co-editing network. Our
results suggest that activity cascades are a statistically significant
phenomenon in more than half of the studied projects. We further show that our
insights can be used to develop a simple yet practical churn prediction method
that forecasts which developers are likely to leave a project. Our work sheds
light on the emergent collective social dynamics in OSS communities and
highlights the importance of activity cascades to understand developer churn
and retention in collaborative software projects.","\label{sec:related}

Understanding social aspects in software development has emerged as an important research area in empirical software engineering, organizational theory, and computational social science. 
Our work builds upon several interconnected research streams that examine temporal collaboration patterns, social networks, and emergent coordination in OSS communities, which we summarize below.

\paragraph{Collaboration Patterns in Software Projects}

The application of social network analysis to software projects has provided important insights into how the structure and temporal patterns of collaboration influence project outcomes.
\citet{zoller2020topology} highlight connections between GitHub collaboration networks and project success, showing how network topology affects the resilience and adaptability of projects.
In particular, their work shows that the hierarchical group structure of collaboration networks influences long-term sustainability and productivity of Open Source communities.
Studying co-editing networks extracted from software repositories, \citet{scholtes2016aristotle} studied the interplay between the densification of collaboration structures and developer productivity.
Mapping the social structure of Free and Open Source Software Communities, \citet{Crowston_Howison_2005} studied interactions in bug fixing processes.
They find that the centralization of communication is an important characteristic that distinguishes projects, where larger communities tend to have more decentralized communication patterns.

The temporal dimension of collaboration networks has gained increasing attention in software engineering research.
\cite{gote2019git2net} developed a method to mine time-stamped co-editing networks from Git repositories, which is a foundation for temporal network analysis in OSS communities.
A follow-up work further showed that the co-editing structure influences the timing of commits, where developers are faster to edit their own code compared to code by other developers \cite{gote2022big}.
Considering temporal patterns of commit behavior, \citet{ma2014dynamics} reveal a power law distribution of file- and project-level inter-commit times, which is an indication of collective dynamics. 
Similarly, \cite{sornette2014much} find a heavy-tail distribution of developer commit contributions, arguing that it is indicative of a collective dynamical process.
Studies of temporal activity patterns reveal that  contribution patterns are strong predictors of sustained engagement \cite{xiao2023early}. 
This finding suggests that responsive behavior early in a developer's participation may influence long-term commitment. 
To understand collaboration dynamics in large software projects, the timing of interactions may thus be as important as their content.

\paragraph{Cascade Analysis in Complex Networks}
While studying the structure of temporal collaboration networks is important, a crucial and less investigated further aspect is that those networks are the substrate of dynamical processes that operate on them.
An important class of processes are \emph{cascades} by which information, failures, diseases or social behavior propagates through complex networks.
This phenomenon has been extensively studied in various complex networks, including social media~\cite{10.1145/2229012.2229058, doi:10.1126/science.aap9559, gomez2012inferring}, financial markets~\cite{10.1257/aer.104.10.3115,10.1257/jel.20151228}, and biological networks~\cite{pastor2015epidemic}. 
Traditional cascade analysis focuses on information propagation~\cite{kempe2003maximizing} or behavioral contagion~\cite{centola2010spread}, where actions by one agent influence the probability of similar actions by connected agents.
However, fewer studies have analyzed the propagation of cascades in the context of collaborative software projects.
Being a natural application of models of failure cascades in technical systems, some studies have considered the propagation of changes or failures in software dependency networks.
\citet{Geipel2009} studied cascades of changes propagating through the dependency networks of Open Source projects.
More recently, \cite{shehata2025cascading} investigated how project failures propagate across the dependency network of the Maven Central ecosystem.
Neither of the two works did link this to the developer collaboration networks of the underlying projects.
While \citet{sornette2014much} studied a ``cascading model of productive activity'' in terms of a Hawkes Poisson process, this model deviates from previously cited works on cascades in the sense that it did not consider the propagation of cascades in a (social) network.
Recently, \citet{schueller2024modeling} demonstrated how risks propagate through dependency and maintainer networks, showing that social factors can amplify technical vulnerabilities.

\paragraph{Modeling and Predicting Developer Turnover}

Research on developer motivation and retention has established theoretical frameworks for understanding collaborative engagement. 
Self\-/Determination Theory (SDT) and Social Identity Theory have been applied to explain how autonomy, competence, and social belonging influence developer participation \cite{10.1145/2214091.2214119}. 
While these theories focus on individual psychological factors, our work examines how social interactions create behavioral cascades that influence collective activity patterns.
The relationship between project characteristics and developer behavior has been explored through various lenses. 
\citet{betti2025dynamics} reveal that leadership changes are common in OSS projects and significantly impact various success metrics. Their findings about leadership transitions provide context for understanding how individual departures can trigger broader changes in project dynamics—a phenomenon that may be related to the cascade effects we investigate.
Studies of value-based discussions in OSS projects have shown that conversations about project values can predict changes in contributor turnover patterns \cite{jamieson2024predicting}. 
This work highlights the importance of social dynamics beyond pure technical considerations, supporting our hypothesis that social responsiveness plays a crucial role in collaborative software development.
The application of survival analysis to understand developer turnover patterns has provided insights into retention factors \cite{lin2017developer}.
Using recent advances in deep graph learning. \citet{chang2024condygnn} use graph neural networks to predict which developers are likely to leave a project.

\paragraph{Research Gap}
While existing research has established foundations for understanding social dynamics in  software projects, several research gaps remain. 
Most studies focus on network properties or individual-level factors, with limited attention to dynamic social processes that emerge from direct developer interactions. 
To the best of our knowledge, no studies examined how developer activity propagates through temporal collaboration networks and how this process shapes the collective dynamics of developer contributions.
Finally, the resulting collective dynamics has not been considered as a factor that influences which developers are likely to leave a project.
Addressing these gaps, our work introduces cascade analysis as a tool to understand collective social dynamics in software development. 
Unlike previous works that treat social behavior as exogenous factor, we position social dynamics as endogeneous driver of collaborative behavior that can be measured, analyzed, and leveraged to improve our understanding of large software projects.","Understanding social aspects in software development has emerged as an important research area in empirical software engineering, organizational theory, and computational social science.
