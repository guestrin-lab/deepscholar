related to inconsistency, stemming from the lack of view-consistent 2D editing
models and the difficulty of ensuring consistent editing across multiple views.
To address these issues, we propose C3Editor, a controllable and consistent
2D-lifting-based 3D editing framework. Given an original 3D representation and
a text-based editing prompt, our method selectively establishes a
view-consistent 2D editing model to achieve superior 3D editing results. The
process begins with the controlled selection of a ground truth (GT) view and
its corresponding edited image as the optimization target, allowing for
user-defined manual edits. Next, we fine-tune the 2D editing model within the
GT view and across multiple views to align with the GT-edited image while
ensuring multi-view consistency. To meet the distinct requirements of GT view
fitting and multi-view consistency, we introduce separate LoRA modules for
targeted fine-tuning. Our approach delivers more consistent and controllable 2D
and 3D editing results than existing 2D-lifting-based methods, outperforming
them in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.","\subsection{Diffusion Model and Fine-tuning}

Diffusion models~\cite{ho2020denoising,rombach2022high} have become powerful tools in generative tasks due to their unique approach of iteratively refining data from noise, allowing for precise control over the generation process. These models learn data distributions through a diffusion process that gradually adds and then reverses noise, effectively modeling complex data patterns in images, audio, and even text. Because of their robust performance, diffusion models are widely applied in tasks~\cite{chen2023fantasia3d,lin2023magic3d, metzer2023latent,wang2024prolificdreamer,xu2024bayesian,srivastava2025lay,zeng2025yolo} such as image synthesis, inpainting, super-resolution, and conditional generation, where they can generate or manipulate visual content based on additional inputs, such as text prompts, segmentation maps, or depth maps. This versatility makes them particularly valuable for tasks requiring high-quality, detailed outputs and subtle adjustments.

Fine-tuning diffusion models is essential for adapting them to specific tasks or datasets. Through targeted fine-tuning, diffusion models can be optimized to perform controlled edits, match stylistic demands, or generalize to new domains beyond their original training data. Techniques such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA)~\cite{hu2021lora} and other parameter-efficient tuning methods~\cite{houlsby2019parameter,li2021prefix,liu2021p} allow for effective customization by focusing on updating key parts of the model while keeping the core structure intact. This approach is especially useful when integrating diffusion models as priors in cross-domain applications, where maintaining high fidelity across varying views is critical. Fine-tuning thus enables diffusion models to meet specialized generative requirements, ensuring they maintain both visual quality and flexibility across diverse tasks.


\subsection{Diffusion-based 2D Editing}

Diffusion-based 2D editing techniques~\cite{avrahami2022blended,hertz2022prompt,kawar2023imagic, meng2021sdedit,ramesh2022hierarchical,brooks2023instructpix2pix} have revolutionized the field of image manipulation by leveraging the denoising diffusion process to transform noise into structured visual representations. In these models, editing is performed iteratively, where each step refines the image by reversing the noise and generating realistic features, allowing for adequate control over the level and type of modifications applied.

The key advantage of diffusion-based 2D editing lies in its ability to use conditional inputs, like text prompts or segmentation maps, to guide the editing process. For example, Instruct-Pix2Pix~\cite{brooks2023instructpix2pix} can interpret prompts to modify colors, add textures, or alter structures while maintaining the coherence of the image. These models can learn data distributions that align with specific editing goals, making them versatile across diverse applications. By fine-tuning or adjusting model parameters, diffusion models can also be specialized for specific editing tasks, allowing them to adapt to particular styles or constraints required by the user. This combination of iterative refinement, conditional control, and adaptability has made diffusion-based 2D editing a powerful tool in modern image generation and editing tasks.

\subsection{2D-lifting-based 3D Editing}

Recent advancements in 3D editing have increasingly integrated diffusion-based 2D editing models, leveraging their established capabilities to enhance 3D workflows~\cite{cao2024mvinpainter,chen2024proedit, chen2024gaussianeditor,haque2023instruct,dong2024vica,chen2024consistdreamer}. These models, originally designed for detailed image modifications, contribute to 3D editing by transferring their proficiency in nuanced, high-quality adjustments to three-dimensional representations. Methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)~\cite{mildenhall2021nerf} and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)~\cite{kerbl20233d} incorporate 2D editing models to improve the consistency and detail of 3D content.

By using 2D diffusion models as priors, recent approaches enhance the fidelity and stylistic consistency of 3D edits, especially in maintaining coherence across multiple views. Some works, such as DGE~\cite{chen2024dge}, combine images from different viewpoints into videos for processing. A primary challenge in this domain remains ensuring multi-view consistency, as traditional 2D-based edits applied to 3D models often lead to discrepancies between perspectives. Some methods, such as ConsistDreamer~\cite{chen2024consistdreamer}, model 3D-aware consistency by means of constraints like neural feature alignment or volume-based feature consistency. This has provided inspiration for our work. However, since it is not open-sourced, it is impossible to make a comparison for now. We compare our method with NeRF-based Instruct-NeRF-to-NeRF~\cite{haque2023instruct}, ViCA-NeRF~\cite{dong2024vica}, and GS-based GaussianEditor~\cite{chen2024gaussianeditor}.
