reasoning over strategic behavior in multi-agent systems (MAS). In many MASs,
the agents (and their strategies) cannot observe the global state of the
system, leading to many extensions of SL centered around imperfect information,
such as strategy logic with imperfect information (SL$_\mathit{ii}$). Along
orthogonal lines, researchers have studied the combination of strategic
behavior and hyperproperties. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate
multiple executions in a system and commonly arise when specifying security
policies. Hyper Strategy Logic (HyperSL) is a temporal logic that combines
quantification over strategies with the ability to express hyperproperties on
the executions of different strategy profiles. In this paper, we study the
relation between SL$_\mathit{ii}$ and HyperSL. Our main result is that both
logics (restricted to formulas where no state formulas are nested within path
formulas) are equivalent in the sense that we can encode SL$_\mathit{ii}$
instances into HyperSL instances and vice versa. For the former direction, we
build on the well-known observation that imperfect information is a
hyperproperty. For the latter direction, we construct a self-composition of
MASs and show how we can simulate hyperproperties using imperfect information.","There exist many extensions of ATL$^*$ and SL to reason about imperfect information \cite{BelardinelliLM19,DimaT11,JamrogaMM19,abs-1908-02488,BelardinelliLMR17,BerthonMM17,HuangM14,HuangM18} or hyperproperties \cite{BeutnerF21,BeutnerF23LMCS,BeutnerF24,BeutnerF24SL}.
The connection between knowledge and hyperproperties has been studied extensively \cite{Rabe16,coenen2020hierarchy,BeutnerFFM23,BeutnerF25a,BeutnerF25b}.
The work most closely related to ours is the study of \cite{BozzelliMP15}, who show that LTL$_K$ and a fragment of HyperCTL* are equally expressive (on standard Kripke structures).
We study the relation of hyperproperties and knowledge in the setting of MASs and strategies.
For example, unlike LTL$_K$, \SLI{} does not use a knowledge operator that we can directly encode. Instead, \SLI{} quantifies over strategies with a given observation relation.","There exist many extensions of ATL$^*$ and SL to reason about imperfect information \cite{BelardinelliLM19,DimaT11,JamrogaMM19,abs-1908-02488,BelardinelliLMR17,BerthonMM17,HuangM14,HuangM18} or hyperproperties \cite{BeutnerF21,BeutnerF23LMCS,BeutnerF24,BeutnerF24SL}.
