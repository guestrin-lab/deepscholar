visual summaries of the reduced state of each qubit, showing the probability,
phase, purity, and/or Bloch sphere coordinates associated with each qubit.
These necessarily provide an incomplete picture of the quantum state of the
qubits, and can sometimes be confusing for students or newcomers to quantum
computing. We contribute two novel visual approaches to provide more complete
information about small circuits. First, to complement information about each
qubit, we show the complete state vector, and illustrate the way that
amplitudes change from layer-to-layer under the effect of different gates, by
using a small set of colors, arrows, and symbols. We call this ``state vector
difference highlighting'', and show how it elucidates the effect of Hadamard,
X, Y, Z, S, T, Phase, and SWAP gates, where each gate may have an arbitrary
combination of control and anticontrol qubits. Second, we display pairwise
information about qubits (such as concurrence and correlation) in a triangular
``half-matrix'' visualization. Our open source software implementation, called
MuqcsCraft, is available as a live online demonstration that runs in a web
browser without installing any additional software, allowing a user to define a
circuit through drag-and-drop actions, and then simulate and visualize it.","\subsection{Visualizations for Quantum Computing}

A growing body of work applies principles of information visualization \cite{munzner2014book} and interaction design
to quantum computing, e.g.,
showing higher-level blocks in a circuit \cite{wen2023quantivine},
allowing users to sketch circuits \cite{arawjo2022},
visualizing and manipulating tensor networks \cite{kissinger2015quantomatic},
visualizing noise \cite{ruan2023vacsen}
and graph states \cite{miller2021},
or enabling a better understanding of
Grover's algorithm \cite{norrie2024qgrover},
Shor's algorithm \cite{tao2017shorvis},
quantum machine learning \cite{ruan2024violet},
and variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) \cite{rudolph2021orqviz}.

% We now review some of the more specific work related to visualization of circuits.
We now review topics related more specifically to our current work.

\subsection{Visualization of circuits}

Compared to previous work,
MuqcsCraft is the only graphical circuit simulator
that highlights differences in the state vector from one layer to the next,
as well as the only to display a triangular half-matrix,
and the only one that computes and shows pairwise concurrence values
to aid in understanding entanglement.
Below we discuss previous work and some of their specific features.


\subsubsection{Popular graphical interfaces}

% Some software simulators,  such as Quirk, allow the user to see each qubit's local state visualized in a small 3-dimensional Bloch sphere.
% On the other hand, IBM Quantum Composer shows each qubit's local state using a ``phase disk'' glyph, showing a probability, phase angle $\phi$, and purity.


IBM Quantum Composer \cite{ibm2023composer}
and Quirk \cite{gidney2020quirk} are both web-based, like MuqcsCraft.
Quantum Composer is limited to 4 qubits without an account and is closed source,
whereas Quirk and MuqcsCraft support 16 qubits and are both open source.
Quantum Composer lacks support for anticontrol qubits,
lacks support for control qubits on certain gates ($T$ and $S$),
supports a maximum of one control qubit on most gates,
and requires several clicks to add this control qubit,
whereas Quirk and MuqcsCraft allow arbitrary control and anticontrol qubits to be added to any gate
with a simple drag-and-drop.
Quantum Composer also has no support for continuously varying the parameters of gates,
whereas Quirk supports animated rotation gates,
and MuqcsCraft allows parameters of gates to be smoothly varied by dragging with the mouse
which triggers continuously updated visual feedback.

% We informally surveyed a quantum computing student club and found that 12 out of 12 members used IBM Quantum Composer to define circuits, and none used Quirk.
% Informal feedback indicates that some users find Quirk's user interface confusing.

To visualize the evolution of the single-qubit reduced states,
both Quantum Composer and Quirk allow widgets to be drag-and-dropped onto the circuit
between each layer of gates,
however MuqcsCraft allows the visibility of reduced states for all layers to be toggled with a single click.

To visualize the evolution of the state vector,
Quantum Composer allows the user to step through the circuit, one layer at a time,
while a single colored barchart of the state vector is updated.
Quirk and MuqcsCraft both display the state vector with wrapping to save space
(and in MuqcsCraft, wrapping is an option that can be toggled).
Quirk allows state vector widgets to be drag-and-dropped onto the circuit
between each layer of gates.
MuqcsCraft instead allows the visibility of state vectors for all layers to be toggled with a single click,
and is the only package to highlight the differences from one layer to the next.


Comparing the two open-source packages,
Quirk is over 40k lines of code versus MuqcsCraft's less than 10k
making it easier to study and understand.
Quirk uses GPU acceleration to simulate circuits faster,
while MuqcsCraft avoids the complexity of GPU programming
and nevertheless simulates circuits of 16 qubits or less in under 10 ms per gate on a 2022 laptop.

\subsubsection{Academic work on circuit visualization}

Rainbow boxes \cite{lamy2019rainbow}
represent qubits with rectangles,
where height shows probability, color shows phase,
and entanglement is indicated by merging rectangles,
however this can only be done for adjacent qubits,
and makes no distinction between qubits that are
partially versus maximally entangled.

QuFlow \cite{lin2018quflow} shows causal relationships between amplitudes from one layer to the next,
and
QuantumEyes \cite{ruan2023quantumeyes} has a Probability Summary View that shows the evolution of
probabilities of base states layer-by-layer.
However, neither of these use
wrapping to make the state vectors consume less
vertical space,
making them less scalable than
Quirk and MuqcsCraft.
% QuantumEyes offers demo but only 2 fixed circuits.  Update: their demo doesn't even fully work anymore.
In addition, there is no obvious way to modify
these techniques to support wrapping.


% don't bother discussing QCVis (Williams 2021) ?

Also, unlike these previous works,
we provide the source code for MuqcsCraft
and a working interactive online demo.

\subsection{Extensions to the Bloch sphere}

Methods for embedding sets of quantum states in space
can be developed through
the perspective of abstract algebra and topology,
discussed in depth by Bengtsson and {\.Z}yczkowski \cite{bengtsson2017geometry}.
Previous works have extended the Bloch sphere
to two qubits \cite{gamel2016,wie2020,chang2024},
e.g., to better understand entanglement,
and even to multiple qubits
\cite{altepeter2009,makela2010,bley2024}, % aharonov2025
however these extensions require 3D geometry
that is difficult to visualize,
and/or have limited scalability to many qubits.
% \mjm{Je n'arrive pas à comprendre \cite{aharonov2025} qui est seulement sur arxiv et n'a pas

In contrast, the triangular half-matrix used in MuqcsCraft
is purely 2D, and occupies an area that scales quadratically with
the number of qubits, allocating one cell for each pair of qubits
to show information about how the pair are related.
