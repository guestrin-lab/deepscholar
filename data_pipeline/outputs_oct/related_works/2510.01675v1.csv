omnidirectional multirotor that explicitly accounts for both servo and rotor
dynamics. Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and
reliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery
from sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware
control for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on
linear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture
the nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit
the cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its
nonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and
establish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal
parametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we
demonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such
uncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not
account for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast
translational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden
disturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking
performance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the
fastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the
proposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks,
thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.","% To overcome the underactuation of quadrotors, platforms with tilted or tiltable rotors have been widely investigated. In particular, variable-tilt designs incorporate servomotors in their actuator. 
Many existing control strategies for conventional multirotors \cite{bouabdallah2005backstepping,lee2010geometric} and omnidirectional multirotors \cite{kamel2018voliro, lee2025autonomous, lee2024autonomous, bodie2021active} simplify the problem by assuming that actuators can respond instantaneously to commanded inputs. While effective for slow movements, this assumption fails during fast trajectory tracking or when recovering from external disturbances. %Especially in variable-tilt drones, in situations where rapid changes in thrust and tilt angle are required, the mismatch in response speed between the rotor and the servo can lead to performance degradation or instability \cite{park2023design}.

% To enhance the stability and tracking performance of multirotor vehicles, especially in dynamic scenarios that require rapid changes in control input, it is crucial to consider the dynamics of their actuators, namely rotors and servomotors. Many foundational control strategies for omnidirectional multirotors \cite{kamel2018voliro, lee2025autonomous, lee2024autonomous, bodie2021active} simplify the problem by assuming that actuators can respond instantaneously to commanded inputs. While effective for slow movements, this assumption fails during fast trajectory tracking or when recovering from external disturbances, situations where rapid changes in thrust and tilt angle are required, potentially leading to performance degradation or instability. \blue{일반적인 actuator dynamics를 고려하지 않았을 때 어찌되는지에 대한 general한 설명, 그 다음 특히 variable-tilt인 경우에는 추가적인 문제가 뭐가 있는지}

% To address these limitations, recent research has begun to incorporate actuator dynamics directly into the controller design. 
To address this issue, recent works begin to incorporate actuator dynamics directly into the controller design. For conventional multirotors, incorporating first-order rotor dynamics improves high speed tracking and robustness \cite{faessler2016thrust,tal2020accurate}. For fixed-tilt platforms where servo dynamics are absent, research has focused on the impact of rotor dynamics. Some studies have modeled the rotor angular speed dynamics as a first-order system and implemented an angular velocity feedback controller \cite{Brescianini2018}. Similarly, a geometric tracking controller was proposed that incorporated a first-order wrench dynamics model \cite{lee2025geometric}. However, for variable-tilt platforms, the wrench dynamics cannot be represented by a single first-order system due to the nonlinearity of the control allocation map. Consequently, variable-tilt multirotors require control strategies that explicitly accommodate these additional nonlinearities.%, successfully achieving almost global exponential stability without requiring direct measurements of the rotor state

% \blue{In fixed-tilt multirotors, only rotor dynamics are present and the allocation mapping is linear, so the wrench dynamics can be modeled directly. In contrast, variable-tilt platforms exhibit two distinct time delay constants (rotor and servo), and the allocation depends nonlinearly on the servo angles, making wrench dynamics modeling substantially more difficult. Since prior work on fixed-tilt platforms exploits this linearity to design controllers, control on variable-tilt platforms requires methods that explicitly handle the additional nonlinearities. Also} 

Another challenge for variable-tilt platforms is the slower response of the tilt servos. To address this problem, a Smith predictor was employed to compensate for known servo delays \cite{ryll2015novel}. A quasi-decoupling controller was also developed, which uses the current servo angle for control allocation to achieve performance independent of the servo's response time \cite{Lee2021_carosq}. Similar approach of using current servo angle in control allocation was also devised in \cite{park2023design} from the observation of slower servomotor response than the rotor response. A common limitation of these approaches is their focus on either rotor or servo dynamics in isolation. %\blue{fixed-tilt 멀티로터에서는 됐는데 variable-tilt에서는 뭐가 다른지 -- servo사용으로 인해 nonlinearity가 발생하고, 기존의 fixed-tilt 연구들은 linearity를 활용해서 제어기를 구성했기 때문에 이런 추가적인 nonlinearity를 다루는 법이 필요하다는 내용}

More recently, efforts have been made to address both actuator dynamics simultaneously. For instance, an approach using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) modeled both rotor thrust dynamics and servo angle dynamics as first-order systems \cite{li2024servo}. However, the substantial computational burden of NMPC remains particularly challenging in scenarios that require high-frequency control and rapid, large changes in actuator inputs. A different strategy, known as differential allocation, addresses actuator velocity limits and dynamics directly within the control allocation module \cite{allenspach2020design}. This approach was later extended to incorporate the power dynamics of the actuators, providing a more comprehensive model at the allocation level \cite{cuniato2024allocation}. However, while these methods are effective, their focus remains on solving the allocation problem itself. Consequently, they do not provide a formal stability analysis for the entire closed-loop system, where the vehicle's rigid-body dynamics are fully coupled with the actuator dynamics, and stability claims in these works are confined to simplified or linearized models. Furthermore, they rely on the assumption of a perfectly known model and do not provide a robustness analysis against model uncertainties.","Many existing control strategies for conventional multirotors \cite{bouabdallah2005backstepping,lee2010geometric} and omnidirectional multirotors \cite{kamel2018voliro, lee2025autonomous, lee2024autonomous, bodie2021active} simplify the problem by assuming that actuators can respond instantaneously to commanded inputs.
