rendered in the cloud and streamed back to the user as a video feed, network
operators are creating monetizable assurance services that dynamically
provision network resources. However, without accurately measuring cloud gaming
user experience, they cannot assess the effectiveness of their provisioning
methods. Basic measures such as bandwidth and frame rate by themselves do not
suffice, and can only be interpreted in the context of the game played and the
player activity within the game. This paper equips the network operator with a
method to obtain a real-time measure of cloud gaming experience by analyzing
network traffic, including contextual factors such as the game title and player
activity stage. Our method is able to classify the game title within the first
five seconds of game launch, and continuously assess the player activity stage
as being active, passive, or idle. We deploy it in an ISP hosting NVIDIA cloud
gaming servers for the region. We provide insights from hundreds of thousands
of cloud game streaming sessions over a three-month period into the dependence
of bandwidth consumption and experience level on the gameplay contexts.","\label{sec:related}

\textbf{Network traffic analysis of cloud gaming services:}
As an emerging type of multimedia streaming service that exhibits high demands on network conditions, cloud gaming services have been analyzed in prior works for their network traffic characteristics, including flow anatomy and volumetric profiles. For example, Lyu \textit{et al.} \cite{lyu_network_2024} discussed the use of network flows during entire user sessions, from platform administration to server selection and gameplay, which serve as indicative signatures for network operators to detect cloud gaming sessions played on different types of user setups by their broadband/mobile subscribers. The works in \cite{lyu_do_2024,carrascosa_cloud_2022,domenico_network_2021} analyzed the bandwidth demands of cloud gaming sessions with different levels of streaming quality settings.
Furthermore, objective quality-of-experience metrics (\eg user input lag, graphic resolution, and streaming frame rates) have also been derived from network quality-of-service (QoS) attributes of game streaming flows \cite{monaco_real-time_2025,lyu_network_2024,baena_measuring_2023}.
For the network observability industry, it has been highlighted that purely using objective QoE metrics such as frame rate cannot effectively measure the quality of game streaming perceived by players, as gameplay contexts, including game titles and player activities, can significantly vary the expected/requested QoE and network QoS levels for good user experience \cite{an_tooth_2025,carvalho_qoe_2024,he_vigor_2024,wu_zgaming_2023,saha_study_2023,iqbal_dissecting_2021,lindstrom_cloud_2020}.
To bridge this gap, we develop a traffic analysis method to classify the contexts of cloud gameplay, enabling network operators to effectively measure user-perceived streaming quality when correlating with the objective QoE metrics.


\textbf{Measuring multimedia services with contexts:}
Gaining visibility into the coarse categories of multimedia streaming contexts has become important for the network observability industry to effectively measure user-perceived streaming quality as delivered by networks \cite{wang_standardizing_2024,varvello_performance_2022,bronzino_inferring_2019,barakabitze_qoe_2018,skorin-kapov_survey_2018,finamore_youtube_2011,mok_inferring_2011}. Prior works have developed methods to classify contexts in popular types of multimedia services such as video streaming \cite{wang_characterizing_2024,zhang_sensei_2021,adarsh_too_2021,bronzino_traffic_2021}, live streaming \cite{madanapalli_reclive_2021,loh_machine_2021}, video conferencing \cite{sharma_estimating_2023,michel_enabling_2022,macmillan_measuring_2021}, voice calling \cite{mauro_experimental_2020,holub_analysis_2018}, online gaming \cite{madanapalli_know_2022,schmidt_modeling_2021}, and virtual reality applications \cite{lyu_metavradar_2023,cheng_are_2022}.
For example, the works in \cite{che_packet_2012,chen_network_2006} focus on the contexts in online gaming that vary the expected network conditions for a good gameplay experience including game titles, genres, the number of players, peripheral status and team communication model.
In \cite{lyu_metavradar_2023,cheng_are_2022}, the authors measured the network demands for a good VR experience that depend on the user activity status and the number of surrounding users.
This work is specialized in classifying the contexts (\ie game titles, gameplay activity patterns, and player activity stages) of cloud game streaming sessions. As demonstrated in a large-scale deployment at an ISP hosting NVIDIA's cloud gaming servers, our method, combined with objective QoE measurement, holds unique value for network operators to better support this highly demanding service by effectively measuring the user-perceived streaming quality.","\textbf{Network traffic analysis of cloud gaming services:}
