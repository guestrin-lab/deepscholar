Security Evaluation of Android apps in budget African Mobile Devices,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18800v1,9152633,\cite{9152633},An Analysis of Pre-installed Android Software,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02713v1,"The open-source nature of the Android OS makes it possible for manufacturers
to ship custom versions of the OS along with a set of pre-installed apps, often
for product differentiation. Some device vendors have recently come under
scrutiny for potentially invasive private data collection practices and other
potentially harmful or unwanted behavior of the pre-installed apps on their
devices. Yet, the landscape of pre-installed software in Android has largely
remained unexplored, particularly in terms of the security and privacy
implications of such customizations. In this paper, we present the first
large-scale study of pre-installed software on Android devices from more than
200 vendors. Our work relies on a large dataset of real-world Android firmware
acquired worldwide using crowd-sourcing methods. This allows us to answer
questions related to the stakeholders involved in the supply chain, from device
manufacturers and mobile network operators to third-party organizations like
advertising and tracking services, and social network platforms. Our study
allows us to also uncover relationships between these actors, which seem to
revolve primarily around advertising and data-driven services. Overall, the
supply chain around Android's open source model lacks transparency and has
facilitated potentially harmful behaviors and backdoored access to sensitive
data and services without user consent or awareness. We conclude the paper with
recommendations to improve transparency, attribution, and accountability in the
Android ecosystem.","Gamba, Julien and Rashed, Mohammed and Razaghpanah, Abbas and Tapiador, Juan and Vallina-Rodriguez, Narseo",2020,,,10.1109/SP40000.2020.00013,
