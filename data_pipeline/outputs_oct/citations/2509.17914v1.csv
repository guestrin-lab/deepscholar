Programming
in Python is highly productive, mainly due to its rich science-oriented
software ecosystem built around the NumPy module. As a result, the demand for
Python support in High Performance Computing (HPC) has skyrocketed. However,
the Python language itself does not necessarily offer high performance. In this
work, we present a workflow that retains Python's high productivity while
achieving portable performance across different architectures. The workflow's
key features are HPC-oriented language extensions and a set of automatic
optimizations powered by a data-centric intermediate representation. We show
performance results and scaling across CPU, GPU, FPGA, and the Piz Daint
supercomputer (up to 23,328 cores), with 2.47x and 3.75x speedups over
previous-best solutions, first-ever Xilinx and Intel FPGA results of annotated
Python, and up to 93.16% scaling efficiency on 512 nodes.","Ziogas, Alexandros Nikolaos and Schneider, Timo and Ben-Nun, Tal and

  Accelerators",http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11659v2,"Dedicated tensor accelerators demonstrate the importance of linear algebra in
modern applications. Such accelerators have the potential for impressive
performance gains, but require programmers to rewrite code using vendor APIs -
a barrier to wider scale adoption. Recent work overcomes this by matching and
replacing patterns within code, but such approaches are fragile and fail to
cope with the diversity of real-world codes.
  We develop ATC, a compiler that uses program synthesis to map regions of code
to specific APIs. The mapping space that ATC explores is combinatorially large,
requiring the development of program classification, dynamic analysis, variable
constraint generation and lexical distance matching techniques to make it
tractable.
  We apply ATC to real-world tensor and linear algebra codes and evaluate them
against four state-of-the-art approaches. We accelerate between 2.6x and 7x
more programs, leading to over an order of magnitude performance improvement.","Mart\'{\i}nez, Pablo Antonio and Woodruff, Jackson and

  Portability",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04546v3,"Fast numerical libraries have been a cornerstone of scientific computing for
decades, but this comes at a price. Programs may be tied to vendor specific
software ecosystems resulting in polluted, non-portable code. As we enter an
era of heterogeneous computing, there is an explosion in the number of
accelerator libraries required to harness specialized hardware. We need a
system that allows developers to exploit ever-changing accelerator libraries,
without over-specializing their code.
  As we cannot know the behavior of future libraries ahead of time, this paper
develops a scheme that assists developers in matching their code to new
libraries, without requiring the source code for these libraries.
  Furthermore, it can recover equivalent code from programs that use existing
libraries and automatically port them to new interfaces. It first uses program
synthesis to determine the meaning of a library, then maps the synthesized
description into generalized constraints which are used to search the program
for replacement opportunities to present to the developer.
  We applied this approach to existing large applications from the scientific
computing and deep learning domains. Using our approach, we show speedups
ranging from 1.1$\times$ to over 10$\times$ on end to end performance when
using accelerator libraries.","Collie, Bruce and Ginsbach, Philip and O'Boyle, Michael F.P.",2019,,https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/PACT.2019.00013,10.1109/PACT.2019.00013,
