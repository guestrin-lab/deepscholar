controller incorporates a novel dual-history architecture, utilizing both a
long-term and short-term input/output (I/O) history of the robot. This control

task randomization as another key source of robustness, fostering better task

capabilities in generating high-fidelity samples from complex distributions
through an iterative refinement process. Despite the empirical success of
diffusion models in motion planning and control, the model-free nature of these
methods does not leverage readily available model information and limits their
generalization to new scenarios beyond the training data (e.g., new robots with
different dynamics). In this work, we introduce Model-Based Diffusion (MBD), an
optimization approach using the diffusion process to solve trajectory
optimization (TO) problems without data. The key idea is to explicitly compute
the score function by leveraging the model information in TO problems, which is
why we refer to our approach as model-based diffusion. Moreover, although MBD
does not require external data, it can be naturally integrated with data of
diverse qualities to steer the diffusion process. We also reveal that MBD has
interesting connections to sampling-based optimization. Empirical evaluations
show that MBD outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and
sampling-based TO methods in challenging contact-rich tasks. Additionally,
MBD's ability to integrate with data enhances its versatility and practical
applicability, even with imperfect and infeasible data (e.g., partial-state
demonstrations for high-dimensional humanoids), beyond the scope of standard
diffusion models.","Pan, Chaoyi and Yi, Zeji and Shi, Guanya and Qu, Guannan",2024,,,,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems

rough but continuous terrains, where the terrain elevation varies gradually.
Locomotion on discontinuous terrains, such as those with gaps or obstacles,
presents a complementary set of challenges. In discontinuous settings, it
becomes necessary to plan ahead using visual inputs and to execute agile
behaviors beyond robust walking, such as jumps. Such dynamic motion results in
significant motion of onboard sensors, which introduces a new set of challenges
for real-time visual processing. The requirement for agility and terrain
awareness in this setting reinforces the need for robust control. We present
Depth-based Impulse Control (DIC), a method for synthesizing highly agile
visually-guided locomotion behaviors. DIC affords the flexibility of model-free
learning but regularizes behavior through explicit model-based optimization of
ground reaction forces. We evaluate the proposed method both in simulation and
in the real world.","Margolis, Gabriel B and Chen, Tao and Paigwar, Kartik and Fu, Xiang and Kim, Donghyun and bae Kim, Sang and Agrawal, Pulkit",,,,,

  Adaptive Mobility",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15783v1,"Recent works in the robot learning community have successfully introduced
generalist models capable of controlling various robot embodiments across a
wide range of tasks, such as navigation and locomotion. However, achieving
agile control, which pushes the limits of robotic performance, still relies on
specialist models that require extensive parameter tuning. To leverage
generalist-model adaptability and flexibility while achieving specialist-level
agility, we propose AnyCar, a transformer-based generalist dynamics model
designed for agile control of various wheeled robots. To collect training data,
we unify multiple simulators and leverage different physics backends to
simulate vehicles with diverse sizes, scales, and physical properties across
various terrains. With robust training and real-world fine-tuning, our model
enables precise adaptation to different vehicles, even in the wild and under
large state estimation errors. In real-world experiments, AnyCar shows both
few-shot and zero-shot generalization across a wide range of vehicles and
environments, where our model, combined with a sampling-based MPC, outperforms
specialist models by up to 54%. These results represent a key step toward
building a foundation model for agile wheeled robot control. We will also
open-source our framework to support further research.","Xiao, Wenli and Xue, Haoru and Tao, Tony and Kalaria, Dvij and Dolan, John M and Shi, Guanya",2024,,,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.15783
