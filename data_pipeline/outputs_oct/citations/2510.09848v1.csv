Cell Instance Segmentation: The Devil Is in the Boundaries,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09848v1,chen2016dcan,\cite{chen2016dcan},DCAN: Deep Contour-Aware Networks for Accurate Gland Segmentation,http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02677v1,"The morphology of glands has been used routinely by pathologists to assess
the malignancy degree of adenocarcinomas. Accurate segmentation of glands from
histology images is a crucial step to obtain reliable morphological statistics
for quantitative diagnosis. In this paper, we proposed an efficient deep
contour-aware network (DCAN) to solve this challenging problem under a unified
multi-task learning framework. In the proposed network, multi-level contextual
features from the hierarchical architecture are explored with auxiliary
supervision for accurate gland segmentation. When incorporated with multi-task
regularization during the training, the discriminative capability of
intermediate features can be further improved. Moreover, our network can not
only output accurate probability maps of glands, but also depict clear contours
simultaneously for separating clustered objects, which further boosts the gland
segmentation performance. This unified framework can be efficient when applied
to large-scale histopathological data without resorting to additional steps to
generate contours based on low-level cues for post-separating. Our method won

it adopts a fully convolutional branch to provide spatial context, which can

introduce a model that unifies both approaches. Our model, the Candidate
Multi-Cut (CMC), allows joint selection and clustering of segment candidates
from a merge-tree. This way, we overcome the respective limitations of the
individual methods: (1) the space of possible segmentations is not constrained
to candidates of a merge-tree, and (2) the decision for clustering can be made
on candidates larger than superpixels, using features over larger contexts. We
solve the optimization problem of selecting and clustering of candidates using
an integer linear program. On datasets of 2D light microscopy of cell
populations and 3D electron microscopy of neurons, we show that our method
generalizes well and generates more accurate segmentations than merge-tree or
Multi-Cut methods alone.","Funke, Jan and Zhang, Chong and Pietzsch, Tobias and Ballester, Miguel A Gonzalez and Saalfeld, Stephan",2018,,,,
