"VR as a ""Drop-In"" Well-being Tool for Knowledge Workers",http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02836v1,constantinides2022future,\cite{constantinides2022future},The Future of Hybrid Meetings,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04977v1,"Meetings are typically considered to be the fuel of an organization's
productivity -- a place where employees discuss ideas and make collective
decisions. However, it is no secret that meetings are also often perceived as
wasteful vacuums, depleting employee morale and productivity, likely due to the
fact that current technologies fall short in fully supporting physical or
virtual meeting experience. In this position paper, we discuss the three key
elements that make a meeting successful (i.e., execution, psychological safety,
and physical comfort), and present new tools for hybrid meetings that
incorporate those elements. As past research has focused on supporting meeting
execution (the first element), we set the roadmap for future research on the
two other elements: on psychological safety by articulating how new
technologies could make meeting useful for all participants, ensure all
participants give and receive appropriate levels of attention, and enable all
participants to feel and make others feel comfortable; and on physical comfort
by dwelling on how new technologies could make the meeting experience
comfortable by integrating all human senses. We also discuss the potential
danger of these technologies inadvertently becoming surveillance tools.","Constantinides, Marios and Quercia, Daniele",,,,,

not occupations themselves, that are affected by AI. To evaluate how tasks may
be impacted, previous approaches utilized manual annotations or coarse-grained
matching. Leveraging recent advancements in machine learning, we replace
coarse-grained matching with more precise deep learning approaches. Introducing
the AI Impact (AII) measure, we employ Deep Learning Natural Language
Processing to automatically identify AI patents that may impact various
occupational tasks at scale. Our methodology relies on a comprehensive dataset
of 17,879 task descriptions and quantifies AI's potential impact through
analysis of 24,758 AI patents filed with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO) between 2015 and 2022. Our results reveal that some occupations
will potentially be impacted, and that impact is intricately linked to specific
skills. These include not only routine tasks (codified as a series of steps),
as previously thought, but also non-routine ones (e.g., diagnosing health
conditions, programming computers, and tracking flight routes). However, AI's
impact on labour is limited by the fact that some of the occupations affected
are augmented rather than replaced (e.g., neurologists, software engineers, air
traffic controllers), and the sectors affected are experiencing labour
shortages (e.g., IT, Healthcare, Transport).","Septiandri, Ali Akbar and Constantinides, Marios and Quercia, Daniele",,,,,PNAS nexus
