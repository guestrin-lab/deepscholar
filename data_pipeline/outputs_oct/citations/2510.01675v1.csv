  Control and Whole-body Planning",http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19608v1,"Aerial manipulators based on conventional multirotors can conduct
manipulation only in small roll and pitch angles due to the underactuatedness
of the multirotor base. If the multirotor base is capable of hovering at
arbitrary orientation, the robot can freely locate itself at any point in
$\mathsf{SE}(3)$, significantly extending its manipulation workspace and
enabling a manipulation task that was originally not viable. In this work, we
present a geometric robust control and whole-body motion planning framework for
an omnidirectional aerial manipulator (OAM). To maximize the strength of OAM,
we first propose a geometric robust controller for a floating base. Since the
motion of the robotic arm and the interaction forces during manipulation affect
the stability of the floating base, the base should be capable of mitigating
these adverse effects while controlling its 6D pose. We then design a two-step
optimization-based whole-body motion planner, jointly considering the pose of
the floating base and the joint angles of the robotic arm to harness the entire
configuration space. The devised two-step approach facilitates real-time
applicability and enhances convergence of the optimization problem with
non-convex and non-Euclidean search space. The proposed approach enables the
base to be stationary at any 6D pose while autonomously carrying out
sophisticated manipulation near obstacles without any collision. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework through experiments in which an OAM
performs grasping and pulling of an object in multiple scenarios, including
near $90^\circ$ and even $180^\circ$ pitch angles.","Lee, Dongjae and Kim, Byeongjun and Kim, H Jin",2025,,,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2508.19608

perching that has been investigated to elongate operation time. This study
presents a new aerial robot capable of both perching and unperching
autonomously on/from a ferromagnetic surface during flight, and a switching
controller to avoid rotor saturation and mitigate overshoot during transition
between free-flight and perching. To enable stable perching and unperching
maneuvers on/from a vertical surface, a lightweight ($\approx$ $1$ \si{kg}),
fully actuated tiltrotor that can hover at $90^\circ$ pitch angle is first
developed. We design a perching/unperching module composed of a single
servomotor and a magnet, which is then mounted on the tiltrotor. A switching
controller including exclusive control modes for transitions between
free-flight and perching is proposed. Lastly, we propose a simple yet effective
strategy to ensure robust perching in the presence of measurement and control
errors and avoid collisions with the perching site immediately after
unperching. We validate the proposed framework in experiments where the
tiltrotor successfully performs perching and unperching on/from a vertical
surface during flight. We further show effectiveness of the proposed transition
mode in the switching controller by ablation studies where large overshoot and
even collision with a perching site occur. To the best of the authors'

high-speed and high-acceleration) maneuvers have attracted significant
attention in the past few years. This paper focuses on accurate tracking of
aggressive quadcopter trajectories. We propose a novel control law for tracking
of position and yaw angle and their derivatives of up to fourth order,
specifically, velocity, acceleration, jerk, and snap along with yaw rate and
yaw acceleration. Jerk and snap are tracked using feedforward inputs for
angular rate and angular acceleration based on the differential flatness of the
quadcopter dynamics. Snap tracking requires direct control of body torque,
which we achieve using closed-loop motor speed control based on measurements
from optical encoders attached to the motors. The controller utilizes
incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) for robust tracking of linear
and angular accelerations despite external disturbances, such as aerodynamic
drag forces. Hence, prior modeling of aerodynamic effects is not required. We
rigorously analyze the proposed control law through response analysis, and we
demonstrate it in experiments. The controller enables a quadcopter UAV to track
complex 3D trajectories, reaching speeds up to 12.9 m/s and accelerations up to
2.1g, while keeping the root-mean-square tracking error down to 6.6 cm, in a
flight volume that is roughly 18 m by 7 m and 3 m tall. We also demonstrate the
robustness of the controller by attaching a drag plate to the UAV in flight
tests and by pulling on the UAV with a rope during hover.","Tal, Ezra and Karaman, Sertac",2020,,,,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology

omnidirectional multirotor to frequently alter the thrust amplitude and

rotor dynamics, significantly affects the omnidirectional multirotor's tracking
performance, especially in aggressive flights. To resolve this issue, we
propose a novel tracking controller that takes the rotor dynamics into account
and does not require additional rotor state measurement. This is achieved by
integrating a linear rotor dynamics model into the vehicle's equations of
motion and designing a PD controller to compensate for the effects introduced
by rotor dynamics. We prove that the proposed controller yields almost global
exponential stability. The proposed controller is validated in experiments,

Our newly developed platform has a cubic exterior and can freely place cargo at

changes when cargo is loaded, leading to undesired attitudinal motion due to
unwanted torque generation. To address this problem, we introduce a new

extremum-seeking control (ESC) technique. Experimental results are presented to
validate the performance of the proposed estimation method, effectively

methods, our approach preserves the full dynamics without simplification. It
directly uses rotor thrust and servo angle as control inputs, where their
limited working ranges are considered input constraints. Notably, we
incorporate a first-order servo model within the NMPC framework. Simulation
reveals that integrating the servo dynamics is not only an enhancement to
control performance but also a critical factor for optimization convergence. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we fabricate a tiltable-quadrotor
