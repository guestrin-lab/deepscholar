  Prediction",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06219v1,"Estimating quality of transmitted speech is known to be a non-trivial task.
While traditionally, test participants are asked to rate the quality of
samples; nowadays, automated methods are available. These methods can be
divided into: 1) intrusive models, which use both, the original and the
degraded signals, and 2) non-intrusive models, which only require the degraded
signal. Recently, non-intrusive models based on neural networks showed to
outperform signal processing based models. However, the advantages of deep
learning based models come with the cost of being more challenging to
interpret. To get more insight into the prediction models the non-intrusive
speech quality prediction model NISQA is analyzed in this paper. NISQA is
composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network
(RNN). The task of the CNN is to compute relevant features for the speech
quality prediction on a frame level, while the RNN models time-dependencies
between the individual speech frames. Different explanation algorithms are used
to understand the automatically learned features of the CNN. In this way,
several interpretable features could be identified, such as the sensitivity to
noise or strong interruptions. On the other hand, it was found that multiple
features carry redundant information.",,,,,,

to enable 0.1 milli-arcsecond (mas) spectral imaging of stellar surfaces and of
the Universe in general and asteroseismic imaging of stellar interiors. SI is
identified as a ""Flagship and Landmark Discovery Mission"" in the 2005 Sun Solar
System Connection (SSSC) Roadmap and as a candidate for a ""Pathways to Life
Observatory"" in the Exploration of the Universe Division (EUD) Roadmap (May,
2005). SI will revolutionize our view of many dynamic astrophysical processes:
its resolution will transform point sources into extended sources, and
snapshots into evolving views. SI's science focuses on the role of magnetism in
the Universe, particularly on magnetic activity on the surfaces of stars like
the Sun. SI's prime goal is to enable long-term forecasting of solar activity
and the space weather that it drives. SI will also revolutionize our
understanding of the formation of planetary systems, of the habitability and
climatology of distant planets, and of many magneto-hydrodynamically controlled
processes in the Universe. The results of the SI ""Vision Mission"" Study are
presented in this paper. Additional information on the SI mission concept and
related technology development can be found at URL:

technical boundaries (such as processing capacity), psychological boundaries
(such as human trust in AI systems), ethical boundaries (such as with AI
weapons), and conceptual boundaries (such as the AI people can imagine). It is

  transductive deep transfer learning",http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12774v1,"Cross-database non-frontal expression recognition is a very meaningful but
rather difficult subject in the fields of computer vision and affect computing.
In this paper, we proposed a novel transductive deep transfer learning
architecture based on widely used VGGface16-Net for this problem. In this
framework, the VGGface16-Net is used to jointly learn an common optimal
nonlinear discriminative features from the non-frontal facial expression
samples between the source and target databases and then we design a novel
transductive transfer layer to deal with the cross-database non-frontal facial
expression classification task. In order to validate the performance of the
proposed transductive deep transfer learning networks, we present extensive
crossdatabase experiments on two famous available facial expression databases,
namely the BU-3DEF and the Multi-PIE database. The final experimental results
show that our transductive deep transfer network outperforms the
state-of-the-art cross-database facial expression recognition methods.",,,,,,
