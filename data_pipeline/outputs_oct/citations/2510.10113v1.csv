technical reports, and GitHub repositories published over the last 10 years on
the recent developments of deep learning techniques for iris recognition,
covering broad topics on algorithm designs, open-source tools, open challenges,
and emerging research. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of deep
learning techniques developed for two main sub-tasks in iris biometrics:
segmentation and recognition. Second, we focus on deep learning techniques for
the robustness of iris recognition systems against presentation attacks and via
human-machine pairing. Third, we delve deep into deep learning techniques for
forensic application, especially in post-mortem iris recognition. Fourth, we
review open-source resources and tools in deep learning techniques for iris
recognition. Finally, we highlight the technical challenges, emerging research
trends, and outlook for the future of deep learning in iris recognition.","Nguyen, Kien and Proen{\c{c}}a, Hugo and Alonso-Fernandez, Fernando",2024,,,,ACM Computing Surveys

  Application",http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11700v1,"Augmented and virtual reality is being deployed in different fields of
applications. Such applications might involve accessing or processing critical
and sensitive information, which requires strict and continuous access control.
Given that Head-Mounted Displays (HMD) developed for such applications commonly
contains internal cameras for gaze tracking purposes, we evaluate the
suitability of such setup for verifying the users through iris recognition. In
this work, we first evaluate a set of iris recognition algorithms suitable for
HMD devices by investigating three well-established handcrafted feature
extraction approaches, and to complement it, we also present the analysis using
four deep learning models. While taking into consideration the minimalistic
hardware requirements of stand-alone HMD, we employ and adapt a recently
developed miniature segmentation model (EyeMMS) for segmenting the iris.
Further, to account for non-ideal and non-collaborative capture of iris, we
define a new iris quality metric that we termed as Iris Mask Ratio (IMR) to
quantify the iris recognition performance. Motivated by the performance of iris
recognition, we also propose the continuous authentication of users in a
non-collaborative capture setting in HMD. Through the experiments on a publicly
available OpenEDS dataset, we show that performance with EER = 5% can be
achieved using deep learning methods in a general setting, along with high
accuracy for continuous user authentication.","Boutros, Fadi and Damer, Naser and Raja, Kiran and Ramachandra, Raghavendra and Kirchbuchner, Florian and Kuijper, Arjan",2020,,,,

iris recognition. Unlike the problem of general object recognition, where
real-valued neural networks can be used to extract pertinent features, iris
recognition depends on the extraction of both phase and magnitude information
from the input iris texture in order to better represent its biometric content.
This necessitates the extraction and processing of phase information that
cannot be effectively handled by a real-valued neural network. In this regard,
we design a fully complex-valued neural network that can better capture the
multi-scale, multi-resolution, and multi-orientation phase and amplitude
features of the iris texture. We show a strong correspondence of the proposed
complex-valued iris recognition network with Gabor wavelets that are used to
generate the classical IrisCode; however, the proposed method enables a new
capability of automatic complex-valued feature learning that is tailored for
iris recognition. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets -
ND-CrossSensor-2013, CASIA-Iris-Thousand and UBIRIS.v2 - and show the benefit
of the proposed network for the task of iris recognition. We exploit
visualization schemes to convey how the complex-valued network, when compared
to standard real-valued networks, extracts fundamentally different features
from the iris texture.","Nguyen, Kien and Fookes, Clinton and Sridharan, Sridha and Ross, Arun",2022,,,,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence

quality due to the uncontrolled environment and the non-cooperative subject. To
ensure that the recognition algorithm is not affected by low-quality images,
traditional hand-crafted factors based methods discard most images, which will
cause system timeout and disrupt user experience. In this paper, we propose a
recognition-oriented quality metric and assessment method for iris image to
deal with the problem. The method regards the iris image embeddings Distance in
Feature Space (DFS) as the quality metric and the prediction is based on deep
neural networks with the attention mechanism. The quality metric proposed in
this paper can significantly improve the performance of the recognition
algorithm while reducing the number of images discarded for recognition, which
is advantageous over hand-crafted factors based iris quality assessment
methods. The relationship between Image Rejection Rate (IRR) and Equal Error
Rate (EER) is proposed to evaluate the performance of the quality assessment
algorithm under the same image quality distribution and the same recognition
algorithm. Compared with hand-crafted factors based methods, the proposed
method is a trial to bridge the gap between the image quality assessment and
biometric recognition. The code is available at
