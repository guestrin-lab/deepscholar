  Models on Mobile Devices",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04278v2,"Training deep learning models on mobile devices recently becomes possible,
because of increasing computation power on mobile hardware and the advantages
of enabling high user experiences. Most of the existing work on machine
learning at mobile devices is focused on the inference of deep learning models
(particularly convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network), but
not training. The performance characterization of training deep learning models
on mobile devices is largely unexplored, although understanding the performance
characterization is critical for designing and implementing deep learning
models on mobile devices.
  In this paper, we perform a variety of experiments on a representative mobile
device (the NVIDIA TX2) to study the performance of training deep learning
models. We introduce a benchmark suite and tools to study performance of
training deep learning models on mobile devices, from the perspectives of
memory consumption, hardware utilization, and power consumption. The tools can
correlate performance results with fine-grained operations in deep learning
models, providing capabilities to capture performance variance and problems at
a fine granularity. We reveal interesting performance problems and
opportunities, including under-utilization of heterogeneous hardware, large
energy consumption of the memory, and high predictability of workload
characterization. Based on the performance analysis, we suggest interesting
research directions.","Liu, Jie and Liu, Jiawen and Du, Wan and Li, Dong",2019,,,10.1109/ICPADS47876.2019.00077,

to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model, while keeping their
training data on the device, thereby decoupling the ability to do machine
learning from the need to store the data in the cloud. However, FL is difficult
to implement realistically, both in terms of scale and systems heterogeneity.
Although there are a number of research frameworks available to simulate FL
algorithms, they do not support the study of scalable FL workloads on
heterogeneous edge devices.
  In this paper, we present Flower -- a comprehensive FL framework that
distinguishes itself from existing platforms by offering new facilities to
execute large-scale FL experiments and consider richly heterogeneous FL device
scenarios. Our experiments show Flower can perform FL experiments up to 15M in
client size using only a pair of high-end GPUs. Researchers can then seamlessly
migrate experiments to real devices to examine other parts of the design space.
We believe Flower provides the community with a critical new tool for FL study
and development.","Beutel, Daniel J. and Topal, Taner and Mathur, Akhil and Qiu, Xinchi and Fernandez-Marques, Javier and Gao, Yan and Sani, Lorenzo and Li, Kwing Hei and Parcollet, Titouan and de Gusmão, Pedro Porto Buarque and Lane, Nicholas D.",2020,,,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.14390

researched for the last few years to handle variety of massively distributed AI
applications to meet up the strict latency requirements. Meanwhile, many
companies have released edge devices with smaller form factors (low power
consumption and limited resources) like the popular Raspberry Pi and Nvidia's
Jetson Nano for acting as compute nodes at the edge computing environments.
Although the edge devices are limited in terms of computing power and hardware
resources, they are powered by accelerators to enhance their performance
behavior. Therefore, it is interesting to see how AI-based Deep Neural Networks
perform on such devices with limited resources.
  In this work, we present and compare the performance in terms of inference
time and power consumption of the four Systems on a Chip (SoCs): Asus Tinker
Edge R, Raspberry Pi 4, Google Coral Dev Board, Nvidia Jetson Nano, and one
microcontroller: Arduino Nano 33 BLE, on different deep learning models and
frameworks. We also provide a method for measuring power consumption, inference
time and accuracy for the devices, which can be easily extended to other
devices. Our results showcase that, for Tensorflow based quantized model, the
Google Coral Dev Board delivers the best performance, both for inference time
and power consumption. For a low fraction of inference computation time, i.e.
less than 29.3% of the time for MobileNetV2, the Jetson Nano performs faster
than the other devices.",S. Baller and A. Jindal and M. Chadha and M. Gerndt,2021,,,,

throughput can increase the time to solution, training is stochastic and time
to solution exhibits high variance, and software and hardware systems are so
diverse that fair benchmarking with the same binary, code, and even
hyperparameters is difficult. We therefore present MLPerf, an ML benchmark that

time-consuming. While prior research has explored many different ways of
reducing DNN training time, the impact of input data pipeline, i.e., fetching
raw data items from storage and performing data pre-processing in memory, has
been relatively unexplored. This paper makes the following contributions: (1)
We present the first comprehensive analysis of how the input data pipeline
affects the training time of widely-used computer vision and audio Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs), that typically involve complex data preprocessing. We analyze
nine different models across three tasks and four datasets while varying
factors such as the amount of memory, number of CPU threads, storage device,
GPU generation etc on servers that are a part of a large production cluster at
Microsoft. We find that in many cases, DNN training time is dominated by data
stall time: time spent waiting for data to be fetched and preprocessed. (2) We
build a tool, DS-Analyzer to precisely measure data stalls using a differential
technique, and perform predictive what-if analysis on data stalls. (3) Finally,
based on the insights from our analysis, we design and implement three simple
but effective techniques in a data-loading library, CoorDL, to mitigate data
stalls. Our experiments on a range of DNN tasks, models, datasets, and hardware
configs show that when PyTorch uses CoorDL instead of the state-of-the-art DALI
data loading library, DNN training time is reduced significantly (by as much as
5x on a single server).","Mohan, Jayashree and Phanishayee, Amar and Raniwala, Ashish and Chidambaram, Vijay",2021,,,,Proc. VLDB Endow.
