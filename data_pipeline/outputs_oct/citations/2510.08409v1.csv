Optimal Stopping in Latent Diffusion Models,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08409v1,george2025analysis,\cite{george2025analysis},"Euclid preparation. XLII. A unified catalogue-level reanalysis of weak
  lensing by galaxy clusters in five imaging surveys",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08036v1,"Precise and accurate mass calibration is required to exploit galaxy clusters
as astrophysical and cosmological probes in the Euclid era. Systematic errors
in lensing signals by galaxy clusters can be empirically estimated by comparing
different surveys with independent and uncorrelated systematics. To assess the
robustness of the lensing results to systematic errors, we carried out
end-to-end tests across different data sets. We performed a unified analysis at
the catalogue level by leveraging the Euclid combined cluster and weak-lensing
pipeline (COMB-CL). COMB-CL will measure weak lensing cluster masses for the
Euclid Survey. Heterogeneous data sets from five independent, recent, lensing
surveys (CHFTLenS, DES~SV1, HSC-SSP~S16a, KiDS~DR4, and RCSLenS), which
exploited different shear and photometric redshift estimation algorithms, were
analysed with a consistent pipeline under the same model assumptions. We
performed a comparison of the amplitude of the reduced excess surface density
and of the mass estimates using lenses from the Planck PSZ2 and SDSS redMaPPer
cluster samples. Mass estimates agree with literature results collected in the
LC2 catalogues. Mass accuracy was further investigated considering the AMICO
detected clusters in the HSC-SSP XXL North field. The consistency of the data
sets was tested using our unified analysis framework. We found agreement
between independent surveys, at the level of systematic noise in Stage-III
surveys or precursors. This indicates successful control over systematics. If
such control continues in Stage-IV, Euclid will be able to measure the weak
lensing masses of around 13000 (considering shot noise only) or 3000 (noise
from shape and large-scale-structure) massive clusters with a signal-to-noise
ratio greater than 3.",,,,,,
