  Representation and Analysis",http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08969v1,"Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field that enables exponential
speed-up over classical algorithms. At the heart of this revolutionary
technology are quantum circuits, which serve as vital tools for implementing,
analyzing, and optimizing quantum algorithms. Recent advancements in quantum
computing and the increasing capability of quantum devices have led to the
development of more complex quantum circuits. However, traditional quantum
circuit diagrams suffer from scalability and readability issues, which limit
the efficiency of analysis and optimization processes. In this research, we
propose a novel visualization approach for large-scale quantum circuits by
adopting semantic analysis to facilitate the comprehension of quantum circuits.
We first exploit meta-data and semantic information extracted from the
underlying code of quantum circuits to create component segmentations and
pattern abstractions, allowing for easier wrangling of massive circuit
diagrams. We then develop Quantivine, an interactive system for exploring and
understanding quantum circuits. A series of novel circuit visualizations are
designed to uncover contextual details such as qubit provenance, parallelism,
and entanglement. The effectiveness of Quantivine is demonstrated through two
usage scenarios of quantum circuits with up to 100 qubits and a formal user
evaluation with quantum experts. A free copy of this paper and all supplemental

  Computing",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14135v1,"Quantum computing has attracted considerable public attention due to its
exponential speedup over classical computing. Despite its advantages, today's
quantum computers intrinsically suffer from noise and are error-prone. To
guarantee the high fidelity of the execution result of a quantum algorithm, it
is crucial to inform users of the noises of the used quantum computer and the
compiled physical circuits. However, an intuitive and systematic way to make
users aware of the quantum computing noise is still missing. In this paper, we
fill the gap by proposing a novel visualization approach to achieve noise-aware
quantum computing. It provides a holistic picture of the noise of quantum
computing through multiple interactively coordinated views: a Computer
Evolution View with a circuit-like design overviews the temporal evolution of
the noises of different quantum computers, a Circuit Filtering View facilitates
quick filtering of multiple compiled physical circuits for the same quantum
algorithm, and a Circuit Comparison View with a coupled bar chart enables
detailed comparison of the filtered compiled circuits. We extensively evaluate
the performance of VACSEN through two case studies on quantum algorithms of
different scales and an in-depth interviews with 12 quantum computing users.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of VACSEN in achieving

exponentially growing dimensionality. At the expense of being bound in its
expressiveness, the discrete and finite subspace of graph states is easier to
investigate via a pictorial framework accompanied with a theoretical toolkit
from the stabilizer formalism. Analyzing hand-drawn graphs is a tedious and
time-consuming task and imposes limitations to the problem sizes that can be
addressed. Similarly, algorithmic studies using adjacency matrices alone lack
the benefit of a visual representation of the states. We argue that applying
visual analytics to investigate graph states can be advantageous. To this end,
we introduce GraphStateVis, a web-based application for the visual analysis of
qubit graph states and their stabilizer groups. Our tool facilitates the
interactive construction of a graph through multiple components supported by
linking and brushing. The user can explore graph-state-specific properties,
including the Pauli-weight distribution of its stabilizer operators and noise
thresholds for entanglement criteria. We propose a use case in the context of
near-term quantum algorithms to illustrate the capabilities of our prototype.
We provide access to GraphStateVis as an open-source project and invite the
broader quantum computing and engineering communities to take advantage of this

networks (QNN) have experienced great advancement in the past few years,
harnessing the advantages of quantum computing to significantly speed up

quantum neural network is quite counter-intuitive and difficult to understand,
due to their unique quantum-specific layers (e.g., data encoding and
measurement) in their architecture. It prevents QNN users and researchers from
effectively understanding its inner workings and exploring the model training
status. To fill the research gap, we propose VIOLET, a novel visual analytics

the design requirements distilled from the interviews with domain experts and
the literature survey, we developed three visualization views: the Encoder View

Ansatz View reveals the temporal evolution of quantum states in the training
process, and the Feature View displays the features a QNN has learned after the
training process. Two novel visual designs, i.e., satellite chart and augmented

  Algorithms",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04695v1,"Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising candidates for finding
practical applications of near to mid-term quantum computers. There has been an
increasing effort to study the intricacies of VQAs, such as the presence or
absence of barren plateaus and the design of good quantum circuit ans\""atze.
Many of these studies can be linked to the loss landscape that is optimized as
part of the algorithm, and there is high demand for quality software tools for
flexibly studying these loss landscapes. In our work, we collect a variety of
techniques that have been used to visualize the training of deep artificial
neural networks and apply them to visualize the high-dimensional loss
landscapes of VQAs. We review and apply the techniques to three types of VQAs:
the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, the Quantum Circuit Born
Machine, and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver. Additionally, we investigate
the impact of noise due to finite sampling in the estimation of loss functions.
For each case, we demonstrate how our visualization techniques can verify
observations from past studies and provide new insights. This work is

which has led to a growing interest among users in learning and applying
quantum computing across various applications. However, quantum circuits, which
are fundamental for implementing quantum algorithms, can be challenging for
users to understand due to their underlying logic, such as the temporal
evolution of quantum states and the effect of quantum amplitudes on the
probability of basis quantum states. To fill this research gap, we propose
QuantumEyes, an interactive visual analytics system to enhance the
interpretability of quantum circuits through both global and local levels. For
the global-level analysis, we present three coupled visualizations to delineate

View to overview the probability evolution of quantum states; a State Evolution
View to enable an in-depth analysis of the influence of quantum gates on the
quantum states; a Gate Explanation View to show the individual qubit states and
facilitate a better understanding of the effect of quantum gates. For the
local-level analysis, we design a novel geometrical visualization Dandelion
Chart to explicitly reveal how the quantum amplitudes affect the probability of
the quantum state. We thoroughly evaluated QuantumEyes as well as the novel
QuantumEyes integrated into it through two case studies on different types of

the Bloch matrix components, leading to three important inequalities, allowing
us to parametrize and visualize the two-qubit state space. Applying the
singular value decomposition naturally separates the degrees of freedom to
local and nonlocal, and simplifies the positivity inequalities. It also allows
us to geometrically represent a state as two entangled Bloch spheres with
superimposed correlation axes. It is shown that unitary transformations, local
or nonlocal, have simple interpretations as axis rotations or mixing of certain
degrees of freedom. The nonlocal unitary invariants of the state are then
derived in terms of local unitary invariants. The positive partial transpose
criterion for entanglement is generalized, and interpreted as a reflection, or
a change of a single sign. The formalism is used to characterize maximally
entangled states, and generalize two qubit isotropic and Werner states.","Gamel, Omar",2016,,,,Physical Review A

three spheres are named the base sphere, entanglement sphere, and fiber sphere.
The base sphere and entanglement sphere represent the reduced density matrix of
the base qubit and the non-local entanglement measure, concurrence, while the
fiber sphere represents the fiber qubit via a simple rotation under a local
single-qubit unitary operation; however, in an entangled bipartite state, the
fiber sphere has no information on the reduced density matrix of the fiber
qubit. When the bipartite state becomes separable, the base and fiber spheres
seamlessly become the single-qubit Bloch spheres of each qubit. Since either
qubit can be chosen as the base qubit, two alternative sets of these three
spheres are available, where each set fully represents the bipartite pure
state, and each set has information of the reduced density matrix of its base
qubit. Comparing this model to the two Bloch balls representing the reduced
density matrices of the two qubits, each Bloch ball corresponds to two unit
spheres in our model, namely, the base and entanglement spheres. The
concurrence-coherence complementarity is explicitly shown on the entanglement
sphere via a single angle.","Wie, Chu-Ryang",2020,,,,Physics

proved a useful pedagogical and conceptual tool as a one-to-one map between
qubit states and points in a 3-D space. However, understanding many important
concepts of quantum mechanics, such as entanglement, requires developing
intuitions about states with a minimum of two qubits, which map one-to-one to
unvisualizable spaces of 6 dimensions and higher. In this paper we circumvent
this visualization issue by creating maps of subspaces of 1- and 2-qubit
systems that quantitatively and qualitatively encode properties of these states
in their geometries. For the 1-qubit case, the subspace approach allows one to
visualize how mixed states relate to different choices of measurement in a
basis-independent way and how to read off the entries in a density matrix
representation of these states from lengths in a simple diagram. For the
2-qubit case, a toroidal map of 2-qubit states illuminates the non-trivial
topology of the state space while allowing one to simultaneously read off, in
distances and angles, the level of entanglement in the 2-qubit state and the
mixed-state properties of its constituent qubits. By encoding states and their
evolutions through quantum logic gates with little to no need of mathematical
formalism, these maps may prove particularly useful for understanding
fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and quantum information at the
introductory level. Interactive versions of the visualizations introduced in
