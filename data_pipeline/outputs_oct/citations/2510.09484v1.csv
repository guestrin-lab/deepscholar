  Minimization",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08217v3,"Probabilistic forecasting relies on past observations to provide a
probability distribution for a future outcome, which is often evaluated against
the realization using a scoring rule. Here, we perform probabilistic
forecasting with generative neural networks, which parametrize distributions on
high-dimensional spaces by transforming draws from a latent variable.
Generative networks are typically trained in an adversarial framework. In
contrast, we propose to train generative networks to minimize a
predictive-sequential (or prequential) scoring rule on a recorded temporal
sequence of the phenomenon of interest, which is appealing as it corresponds to
the way forecasting systems are routinely evaluated. Adversarial-free
minimization is possible for some scoring rules; hence, our framework avoids
the cumbersome hyperparameter tuning and uncertainty underestimation due to
unstable adversarial training, thus unlocking reliable use of generative
networks in probabilistic forecasting. Further, we prove consistency of the
minimizer of our objective with dependent data, while adversarial training
assumes independence. We perform simulation studies on two chaotic dynamical
models and a benchmark data set of global weather observations; for this last
example, we define scoring rules for spatial data by drawing from the relevant
literature. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial approaches,
especially in probabilistic calibration, while requiring less hyperparameter
tuning.","Pacchiardi, Lorenzo and Adewoyin, Rilwan A. and Dueben, Peter and Dutta, Ritabrata",2024,,http://jmlr.org/papers/v25/23-0038.html,,

  weather forecasting at scale",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12144v2,"FourCastNet 3 advances global weather modeling by implementing a scalable,
geometric machine learning (ML) approach to probabilistic ensemble forecasting.
The approach is designed to respect spherical geometry and to accurately model
the spatially correlated probabilistic nature of the problem, resulting in
stable spectra and realistic dynamics across multiple scales. FourCastNet 3
delivers forecasting accuracy that surpasses leading conventional ensemble
models and rivals the best diffusion-based methods, while producing forecasts 8
to 60 times faster than these approaches. In contrast to other ML approaches,
FourCastNet 3 demonstrates excellent probabilistic calibration and retains
realistic spectra, even at extended lead times of up to 60 days. All of these
advances are realized using a purely convolutional neural network architecture
tailored for spherical geometry. Scalable and efficient large-scale training on
1024 GPUs and more is enabled by a novel training paradigm for combined model-
and data-parallelism, inspired by domain decomposition methods in classical
numerical models. Additionally, FourCastNet 3 enables rapid inference on a
single GPU, producing a 60-day global forecast at 0.25{\deg}, 6-hourly
resolution in under 4 minutes. Its computational efficiency, medium-range
probabilistic skill, spectral fidelity, and rollout stability at subseasonal
timescales make it a strong candidate for improving meteorological forecasting
and early warning systems through large ensemble predictions.","Bonev, Boris and Kurth, Thorsten and Mahesh, Ankur and Bisson, Mauro and Kossaifi, Jean and Kashinath, Karthik and Anandkumar, Anima and Collins, William D. and Pritchard, Michael S. and Keller, Alexander",2025,,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12144,10.48550/arXiv.2507.12144,

predicting the evolution of thunderstorms and mesoscale convective systems that

km-scale atmospheric simulation, despite being competitive at coarser

evidence of successfully learnt km-scale dynamics including competitive 1-6

realistic convective cluster evolution, moist updrafts, and cold pool

used in operational weather forecasting across the contiguous United States

HRRRCast, a data-driven emulator built with advanced machine learning
techniques. HRRRCast includes two architectures: a ResNet-based model (ResHRRR)
and a Graph Neural Network-based model (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR uses convolutional
neural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise
Linear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a
single model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy
rollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity
over the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR
outperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves
competitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the
StormCast model of Pathak et al. [21] by: a) training on the full CONUS domain,
b) using multiple lead times to improve long-range skill, c) training on
analysis data instead of the +1h post-analysis data inadvertently used in
StormCast, and d) incorporating future GFS states as inputs, enabling
downscaling that improves long-lead accuracy. Grid-, neighborhood-, and
object-based metrics confirm better storm placement, lower frequency bias, and
higher success ratios than HRRR. HRRRCast ensemble forecasts also maintain
sharper spatial detail, with power spectra more closely matching HRRR analysis.
While GraphHRRR underperforms in its current form, it lays groundwork for
future graph-based forecasting. HRRRCast represents a step toward efficient,
data-driven regional weather prediction with competitive accuracy and ensemble
capability.","Abdi, Daniel and Jankov, Isidora and Madden, Paul and Vargas, Vanderlei and Smith, Timothy A and Frolov, Sergey and Flora, Montgomery and Potvin, Corey",2025,,,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2507.05658
