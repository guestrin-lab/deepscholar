  Repositories",http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10180v1,"Data from software repositories have become an important foundation for the
empirical study of software engineering processes. A recurring theme in the
repository mining literature is the inference of developer networks capturing
e.g. collaboration, coordination, or communication from the commit history of
projects. Most of the studied networks are based on the co-authorship of
software artefacts defined at the level of files, modules, or packages. While
this approach has led to insights into the social aspects of software
development, it neglects detailed information on code changes and code
ownership, e.g. which exact lines of code have been authored by which
developers, that is contained in the commit log of software projects.
Addressing this issue, we introduce git2net, a scalable python software that
facilitates the extraction of fine-grained co-editing networks in large git
repositories. It uses text mining techniques to analyse the detailed history of
textual modifications within files. This information allows us to construct
directed, weighted, and time-stamped networks, where a link signifies that one
developer has edited a block of source code originally written by another
developer. Our tool is applied in case studies of an Open Source and a
commercial software project. We argue that it opens up a massive new source of
high-resolution data on human collaboration patterns.","Gote, Christoph and Scholtes, Ingo and Schweitzer, Frank",2019,,,,

  GitHub Data Set",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04588v1,"Massive data from software repositories and collaboration tools are widely
used to study social aspects in software development. One question that several
recent works have addressed is how a software project's size and structure
influence team productivity, a question famously considered in Brooks' law.
Recent studies using massive repository data suggest that developers in larger
teams tend to be less productive than smaller teams. Despite using similar
methods and data, other studies argue for a positive linear or even
super-linear relationship between team size and productivity, thus contesting
the view of software economics that software projects are diseconomies of
scale. In our work, we study challenges that can explain the disagreement
between recent studies of developer productivity in massive repository data. We
further provide, to the best of our knowledge, the largest, curated corpus of
GitHub projects tailored to investigate the influence of team size and
collaboration patterns on individual and collective productivity. Our work
contributes to the ongoing discussion on the choice of productivity metrics in
the operationalisation of hypotheses about determinants of successful software
projects. It further highlights general pitfalls in big data analysis and shows
that the use of bigger data sets does not automatically lead to more reliable
insights.","Gote, Christoph and Mavrodiev, Pavlin and Schweitzer, Frank and Scholtes, Ingo",2022,,,,

growth of production ($R \sim c^\beta$) as a function of the number of active
developers $c$, with $\beta \simeq 4/3$ with large dispersions. For a typical
project in this class, doubling of the group size multiplies typically the
output by a factor $2^\beta=2.5$, explaining the title. This superlinear law is
found to hold for group sizes ranging from 5 to a few hundred developers. We
propose two classes of mechanisms, {\it interaction-based} and {\it large
deviation}, along with a cascade model of productive activity, which unifies
them. In this common framework, superlinear productivity requires that the
involved social groups function at or close to criticality, in the sense of a
subtle balance between order and disorder. We report the first empirical test
of the renormalization of the exponent of the distribution of the sizes of
first generation events into the renormalized exponent of the distribution of
clusters resulting from the cascade of triggering over all generation in a
critical branching process in the non-meanfield regime. Finally, we document a
size effect in the strength and variability of the superlinear effect, with
smaller groups exhibiting widely distributed superlinear exponents, some of
them characterizing highly productive teams. In contrast, large groups tend to
have a smaller superlinearity and less variability.","Sornette, Didier and Maillart, Thomas and Ghezzi, Giacomo",2014,,,,Plos one

  GitHub Projects?",http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06005v4,"Although the open source model bears many advantages in software development,
open source projects are always hard to sustain. Previous research on open
source sustainability mainly focuses on projects that have already reached a
certain level of maturity (e.g., with communities, releases, and downstream
projects). However, limited attention is paid to the development of
(sustainable) open source projects in their infancy, and we believe an
understanding of early sustainability determinants is crucial for project
initiators, incubators, newcomers, and users.
  In this paper, we aim to explore the relationship between early participation
factors and long-term project sustainability. We leverage a novel methodology
combining the Blumberg model of performance and machine learning to predict the
sustainability of 290,255 GitHub projects. Specificially, we train an XGBoost
model based on early participation (first three months of activity) in 290,255
GitHub projects and we interpret the model using LIME. We quantitatively show
that early participants have a positive effect on project's future sustained
activity if they have prior experience in OSS project incubation and
demonstrate concentrated focus and steady commitment. Participation from
non-code contributors and detailed contribution documentation also promote
project's sustained activity. Compared with individual projects, building a
community that consists of more experienced core developers and more active
peripheral developers is important for organizational projects. This study
provides unique insights into the incubation and recognition of sustainable
open source projects, and our interpretable prediction approach can also offer
guidance to open source project initiators and newcomers.","Xiao, Wenxin and He, Hao and Xu, Weiwei and Zhang, Yuxia and Zhou, Minghui",2023,,,,

place in networks. While it is often possible to directly observe when nodes
become infected with a virus or adopt the information, observing individual
transmissions (i.e., who infects whom, or who influences whom) is typically
very difficult. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network over
which the diffusions and propagations spread is actually unobserved. We tackle
these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of diffusion and
influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions
propagate. Given the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become
infected, we identify the optimal network that best explains the observed
infection times. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, we
develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and
finds provably near-optimal networks.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information
diffusion in a set of 170 million blogs and news articles over a one year
period to infer how information flows through the online media space. We find
that the diffusion network of news for the top 1,000 media sites and blogs
tends to have a core-periphery structure with a small set of core media sites
that diffuse information to the rest of the Web. These sites tend to have
stable circles of influence with more general news media sites acting as
connectors between them.","Gomez-Rodriguez, Manuel and Leskovec, Jure and Krause, Andreas",2012,,,,ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD)

two kinds of risks in these systems: that technical problems like bugs and
vulnerabilities can spread through dependency links, and that relatively few
developers are responsible for maintaining even the most widely used libraries.
However, a more holistic diagnosis of systemic risk in software ecosystem
should consider how these social and technical sources of risk interact and
amplify one another. Motivated by the observation that the same individuals
maintain several libraries within dependency networks, we present a
methodological framework to measure risk in software ecosystems as a function
of both dependencies and developers. In our models, a library's chance of
failure increases as its developers leave and as its upstream dependencies
fail. We apply our method to data from the Rust ecosystem, highlighting several
systemically important libraries that are overlooked when only considering
technical dependencies. We compare potential interventions, seeking better ways
to deploy limited developer resources with a view to improving overall
ecosystem health and software supply chain resilience.","Schueller, William and Wachs, Johannes",2024,,,,Collective intelligence
