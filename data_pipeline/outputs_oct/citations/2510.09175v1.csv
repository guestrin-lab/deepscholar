  Graph Information Bottleneck",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03612v4,"Developing a new diagnostic models based on the underlying biological
mechanisms rather than subjective symptoms for psychiatric disorders is an
emerging consensus. Recently, machine learning-based classifiers using
functional connectivity (FC) for psychiatric disorders and healthy controls are
developed to identify brain markers. However, existing machine learning-based
diagnostic models are prone to over-fitting (due to insufficient training
samples) and perform poorly in new test environment. Furthermore, it is
difficult to obtain explainable and reliable brain biomarkers elucidating the
underlying diagnostic decisions. These issues hinder their possible clinical
applications. In this work, we propose BrainIB, a new graph neural network
(GNN) framework to analyze functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI), by
leveraging the famed Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. BrainIB is able to
identify the most informative edges in the brain (i.e., subgraph) and
generalizes well to unseen data. We evaluate the performance of BrainIB against
3 baselines and 7 state-of-the-art brain network classification methods on
three psychiatric datasets and observe that our BrainIB always achieves the
highest diagnosis accuracy. It also discovers the subgraph biomarkers which are
consistent to clinical and neuroimaging findings. The source code and

HYBRID which aims to extract MIMR high-order relationships from fMRI data.
HYBRID employs a CONSTRUCTOR to identify hyperedge structures, and a WEIGHTER

hurdle in order to understand their structure and topological features.
Therefore, mapping the original network into a smaller one while preserving its
information is an important issue. Extracting the so-called backbone of a
network is a very challenging problem that is generally handled either by
coarse-graining or filter-based methods. Coarse-graining methods reduce the
network size by grouping similar nodes, while filter-based methods prune the
network by discarding nodes or edges based on a statistical property. In this
paper, we propose and investigate two filter-based methods exploiting the
overlapping community structure in order to extract the backbone in weighted
networks. Indeed, highly connected nodes (hubs) and overlapping nodes are at
the heart of the network. In the first method, called ""overlapping nodes ego
backbone"", the backbone is formed simply from the set of overlapping nodes and
their neighbors. In the second method, called ""overlapping nodes and hubs
backbone"", the backbone is formed from the set of overlapping nodes and the
hubs. For both methods, the links with the lowest weights are removed from the
network as long as a backbone with a single connected component is preserved.
Experiments have been performed on real-world weighted networks originating
from various domains (social, co-appearance, collaboration, biological, and
technological) and different sizes. Results show that both backbone extraction
methods are quite similar. Furthermore, comparison with the most influential

involving graph classification. However, dense brain graphs pose computational
challenges including high runtime and memory usage and limited
interpretability. In this paper, we investigate effective designs in Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) to sparsify brain graphs by eliminating noisy edges.
While prior works remove noisy edges based on explainability or task-irrelevant
properties, their effectiveness in enhancing performance with sparsified graphs
is not guaranteed. Moreover, existing approaches often overlook collective edge
removal across multiple graphs.
  To address these issues, we introduce an iterative framework to analyze
different sparsification models. Our findings are as follows: (i) methods
prioritizing interpretability may not be suitable for graph sparsification as
they can degrade GNNs' performance in graph classification tasks; (ii)
simultaneously learning edge selection with GNN training is more beneficial
than post-training; (iii) a shared edge selection across graphs outperforms
separate selection for each graph; and (iv) task-relevant gradient information
aids in edge selection. Based on these insights, we propose a new model,

  Robust Graph Convolution Networks",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16418v1,"Graph convolution networks (GCNs) are extensively utilized in various graph
tasks to mine knowledge from spatial data. Our study marks the pioneering
attempt to quantitatively investigate the GCN robustness over omnipresent
heterophilic graphs for node classification. We uncover that the predominant
vulnerability is caused by the structural out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. This
finding motivates us to present a novel method that aims to harden GCNs by
automatically learning Latent Homophilic Structures over heterophilic graphs.
We term such a methodology as LHS. To elaborate, our initial step involves
learning a latent structure by employing a novel self-expressive technique
based on multi-node interactions. Subsequently, the structure is refined using
a pairwisely constrained dual-view contrastive learning approach. We
iteratively perform the above procedure, enabling a GCN model to aggregate
information in a homophilic way on heterophilic graphs. Armed with such an
adaptable structure, we can properly mitigate the structural OOD threats over
heterophilic graphs. Experiments on various benchmarks show the effectiveness
of the proposed LHS approach for robust GCNs.","Qiu, Chenyang and Nan, Guoshun and Xiong, Tianyu and Deng, Wendi and Wang, Di and Teng, Zhiyang and Sun, Lijuan and Cui, Qimei and Tao, Xiaofeng",2024,,,,

between different objects and has been widely used on various learning tasks.
Most methods implicitly assume a given graph to be accurate and complete.
However, real data is inevitably noisy and sparse, which will lead to inferior
results. Despite the remarkable success of recent graph representation learning
methods, they inherently presume that the graph is homophilic, and largely
overlook heterophily, where most connected nodes are from different classes. In
this regard, we propose a novel robust graph structure learning method to
achieve a high-quality graph from heterophilic data for downstream tasks. We
first apply a high-pass filter to make each node more distinctive from its
neighbors by encoding structure information into the node features. Then, we
learn a robust graph with an adaptive norm characterizing different levels of
noise. Afterwards, we propose a novel regularizer to further refine the graph
structure. Clustering and semi-supervised classification experiments on
heterophilic graphs verify the effectiveness of our method.","Xie, Xuanting and Chen, Wenyu and Kang, Zhao",2025,,,,Neural Networks

due to its ability to optimize both the parameters of Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) and the computation graph structure simultaneously. Despite the
proliferation of GSL methods developed in recent years, there is no standard
experimental setting or fair comparison for performance evaluation, which
creates a great obstacle to understanding the progress in this field. To fill
this gap, we systematically analyze the performance of GSL in different
scenarios and develop a comprehensive Graph Structure Learning Benchmark (GSLB)
curated from 20 diverse graph datasets and 16 distinct GSL algorithms.
Specifically, GSLB systematically investigates the characteristics of GSL in
terms of three dimensions: effectiveness, robustness, and complexity. We
comprehensively evaluate state-of-the-art GSL algorithms in node- and
graph-level tasks, and analyze their performance in robust learning and model
complexity. Further, to facilitate reproducible research, we have developed an
easy-to-use library for training, evaluating, and visualizing different GSL
methods. Empirical results of our extensive experiments demonstrate the ability
of GSL and reveal its potential benefits on various downstream tasks, offering
insights and opportunities for future research. The code of GSLB is available

  Diffusion-based Graph Contrastive Learning",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18329v1,"Brain network analysis plays an increasingly important role in studying brain
function and the exploring of disease mechanisms. However, existing brain
network construction tools have some limitations, including dependency on
empirical users, weak consistency in repeated experiments and time-consuming
processes. In this work, a diffusion-based brain network pipeline, DGCL is
designed for end-to-end construction of brain networks. Initially, the brain
region-aware module (BRAM) precisely determines the spatial locations of brain
regions by the diffusion process, avoiding subjective parameter selection.
Subsequently, DGCL employs graph contrastive learning to optimize brain
connections by eliminating individual differences in redundant connections
unrelated to diseases, thereby enhancing the consistency of brain networks
within the same group. Finally, the node-graph contrastive loss and
classification loss jointly constrain the learning process of the model to
obtain the reconstructed brain network, which is then used to analyze important
brain connections. Validation on two datasets, ADNI and ABIDE, demonstrates
that DGCL surpasses traditional methods and other deep learning models in
predicting disease development stages. Significantly, the proposed model
improves the efficiency and generalization of brain network construction. In
summary, the proposed DGCL can be served as a universal brain network
construction scheme, which can effectively identify important brain connections
through generative paradigms and has the potential to provide disease
interpretability support for neuroscience research.","Zong, Yongcheng and Zuo, Qiankun and Ng, Michael Kwok-Po and Lei, Baiying and Wang, Shuqiang",2024,,,,IEEE Trans. Pattern. Anal. Mach. Intell.
