datasets, constructing a large-scale medical image segmentation dataset
encompassing various modalities and objects. Then, we comprehensively fine-tune
SAM on this dataset and turn it into SAM-Med2D. Unlike previous methods that
only adopt bounding box or point prompts as interactive segmentation approach,
we adapt SAM to medical image segmentation through more comprehensive prompts
involving bounding boxes, points, and masks. We additionally fine-tune the
encoder and decoder of the original SAM to obtain a well-performed SAM-Med2D,
leading to the most comprehensive fine-tuning strategies to date. Finally, we
conducted a comprehensive evaluation and analysis to investigate the
performance of SAM-Med2D in medical image segmentation across various
modalities, anatomical structures, and organs. Concurrently, we validated the
generalization capability of SAM-Med2D on 9 datasets from MICCAI 2023
challenge. Overall, our approach demonstrated significantly superior
performance and generalization capability compared to SAM.","Cheng, Junlong and Ye, Jin and Deng, Zhongying and Chen, Jianpin and Li, Tianbin and Wang, Haoyu and Su, Yanzhou and Huang, Ziyan and Chen, Jilong and Jiang, Lei and others",2023,,,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.16184

that allows users to precisely and effectively segment and track any object in
a video. Additionally, SAM-Track employs multimodal interaction methods that
enable users to select multiple objects in videos for tracking, corresponding
to their specific requirements. These interaction methods comprise click,
stroke, and text, each possessing unique benefits and capable of being employed
in combination. As a result, SAM-Track can be used across an array of fields,
ranging from drone technology, autonomous driving, medical imaging, augmented
reality, to biological analysis. SAM-Track amalgamates Segment Anything Model
(SAM), an interactive key-frame segmentation model, with our proposed AOT-based
tracking model (DeAOT), which secured 1st place in four tracks of the VOT 2022
challenge, to facilitate object tracking in video. In addition, SAM-Track
incorporates Grounding-DINO, which enables the framework to support text-based

DAVIS-2016 Val (92.0%), DAVIS-2017 Test (79.2%)and its practicability in

high-performance interactive tracking and segmentation in videos. To be
detailed, given a video sequence, only with very little human participation,
i.e., several clicks, people can track anything they are interested in, and get
satisfactory results in one-pass inference. Without additional training, such
an interactive design performs impressively on video object tracking and

zero-shot image segmentation model, enabled by efficient point-centric

well explored in interactive image segmentation, the existing methods on videos

method for point-centric interactive video segmentation, empowered by SAM and
long-term point tracking. SAM-PT leverages robust and sparse point selection
and propagation techniques for mask generation. Compared to traditional
object-centric mask propagation strategies, we uniquely use point propagation
to exploit local structure information agnostic to object semantics. We
highlight the merits of point-based tracking through direct evaluation on the
zero-shot open-world Unidentified Video Objects (UVO) benchmark. Our
experiments on popular video object segmentation and multi-object segmentation
tracking benchmarks, including DAVIS, YouTube-VOS, and BDD100K, suggest that a
point-based segmentation tracker yields better zero-shot performance and
efficient interactions. We release our code that integrates different point

segmenting everything everywhere all at once in an image, as shown in Fig.1. In
SEEM, we propose a novel decoding mechanism that enables diverse prompting for
all types of segmentation tasks, aiming at a universal segmentation interface
that behaves like large language models (LLMs). More specifically, SEEM is
designed with four desiderata: i) Versatility. We introduce a new visual prompt
to unify different spatial queries including points, boxes, scribbles and
masks, which can further generalize to a different referring image; ii)
Compositionality. We learn a joint visual-semantic space between text and
visual prompts, which facilitates the dynamic composition of two prompt types
required for various segmentation tasks; iii) Interactivity. We further
incorporate learnable memory prompts into the decoder to retain segmentation
history through mask-guided cross-attention from decoder to image features; and
iv) Semantic-awareness. We use a text encoder to encode text queries and mask
labels into the same semantic space for open-vocabulary segmentation. We
conduct a comprehensive empirical study to validate the effectiveness of SEEM
across diverse segmentation tasks. Notably, our single SEEM model achieves
competitive performance across interactive segmentation, generic segmentation,
referring segmentation, and video object segmentation on 9 datasets with
minimum 1/100 supervision. Furthermore, SEEM showcases a remarkable capacity
for generalization to novel prompts or their combinations, rendering it a
readily universal image segmentation interface.","Zou, Xueyan and Yang, Jianwei and Zhang, Hao and Li, Feng and Li, Linjie and Wang, Jianfeng and Wang, Lijuan and Gao, Jianfeng and Lee, Yong Jae",2024,,,,

  Segmentation",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09782v3,"This paper focuses on developing a more effective method of hierarchical
propagation for semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (VOS). Based on
vision transformers, the recently-developed Associating Objects with
Transformers (AOT) approach introduces hierarchical propagation into VOS and
has shown promising results. The hierarchical propagation can gradually
propagate information from past frames to the current frame and transfer the
current frame feature from object-agnostic to object-specific. However, the
increase of object-specific information will inevitably lead to the loss of
object-agnostic visual information in deep propagation layers. To solve such a
problem and further facilitate the learning of visual embeddings, this paper
proposes a Decoupling Features in Hierarchical Propagation (DeAOT) approach.
Firstly, DeAOT decouples the hierarchical propagation of object-agnostic and
object-specific embeddings by handling them in two independent branches.
Secondly, to compensate for the additional computation from dual-branch
propagation, we propose an efficient module for constructing hierarchical
propagation, i.e., Gated Propagation Module, which is carefully designed with
single-head attention. Extensive experiments show that DeAOT significantly
outperforms AOT in both accuracy and efficiency. On YouTube-VOS, DeAOT can
achieve 86.0% at 22.4fps and 82.0% at 53.4fps. Without test-time augmentations,
we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, i.e.,
YouTube-VOS (86.2%), DAVIS 2017 (86.2%), DAVIS 2016 (92.9%), and VOT 2020

by marrying Transformer-based detector DINO with grounded pre-training, which
can detect arbitrary objects with human inputs such as category names or
referring expressions. The key solution of open-set object detection is
introducing language to a closed-set detector for open-set concept
generalization. To effectively fuse language and vision modalities, we
conceptually divide a closed-set detector into three phases and propose a tight
fusion solution, which includes a feature enhancer, a language-guided query
selection, and a cross-modality decoder for cross-modality fusion. While
previous works mainly evaluate open-set object detection on novel categories,
we propose to also perform evaluations on referring expression comprehension
for objects specified with attributes. Grounding DINO performs remarkably well
on all three settings, including benchmarks on COCO, LVIS, ODinW, and
RefCOCO/+/g. Grounding DINO achieves a $52.5$ AP on the COCO detection

impressive performance in image segmentation. However, it lacks proficiency in
referring video object segmentation (RVOS) due to the need for precise

explores the potential of SAM for RVOS by incorporating multi-view information
from diverse modalities and successive frames at different timestamps in an
online manner. Our proposed approach adapts the original SAM model to enhance
cross-modality learning by employing a lightweight Cross-Modal MLP that
projects the text embedding of the referring expression into sparse and dense
embeddings, serving as user-interactive prompts. Additionally, we have
introduced the hierarchical dense attention module to fuse hierarchical visual
semantic information with sparse embeddings to obtain fine-grained dense
embeddings, and an implicit tracking module to generate a tracking token and
provide historical information for the mask decoder. Furthermore, we employ a
parameter-efficient tuning strategy to align and fuse the language and vision
features effectively. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate
our model's practical and effective design choices. Extensive experiments
