  Head-Mounted Displays",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06825v2,"Hand-based interaction, such as using a handheld controller or making hand
gestures, has been widely adopted as the primary method for interacting with
both virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) head-mounted displays
(HMDs). In contrast, hands-free interaction avoids the need for users' hands
and although it can afford additional benefits, there has been limited research
in exploring and evaluating hands-free techniques for these HMDs. As VR HMDs
become ubiquitous, people will need to do text editing, which requires
selecting text segments. Similar to hands-free interaction, text selection is
underexplored. This research focuses on both, text selection via hands-free
interaction. Our exploration involves a user study with 24 participants to
investigate the performance, user experience, and workload of three hands-free
selection mechanisms (Dwell, Blink, Voice) to complement head-based pointing.
Results indicate that Blink outperforms Dwell and Voice in completion time.
Users' subjective feedback also shows that Blink is the preferred technique for
text selection. This work is the first to explore hands-free interaction for
text selection in VR HMDs. Our results provide a solid platform for further
research in this important area.","Meng, Xuanru and Xu, Wenge and Liang, Hai-Ning",2022,,,10.1109/ISMAR55827.2022.00021,

There is a
limited number of available hands-free techniques, which allow users to carry
out text entry when users' hands are busy such as holding items or hand-based
devices are not available. The most used hands-free text entry technique is
DwellType, where a user selects a letter by dwelling over it for a specific
period. However, its performance is limited due to the fixed dwell time for
each character selection. In this paper, we explore two other hands-free text
entry mechanisms in VR: BlinkType and NeckType, which leverage users' eye
blinks and neck's forward and backward movements to select letters. With a user
study, we compare the performance of the two techniques with DwellType. Results
show that users can achieve an average text entry rate of 13.47, 11.18 and
11.65 words per minute with BlinkType, NeckType, and DwellType, respectively.
Users' subjective feedback shows BlinkType as the preferred technique for text
entry in VR.","Lu, Xueshi and Yu, Difeng and Liang, Hai-Ning and Xu, Wenge and Chen, Yuzheng and Li, Xiang and Hasan, Khalad",2020,,,10.1109/ISMAR50242.2020.00061,
