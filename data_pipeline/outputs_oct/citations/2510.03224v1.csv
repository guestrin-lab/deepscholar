nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural

the dominant approach is to extend BN to capture this mixture of distribution,

observe better model smoothness and larger decision margins from NoFrost, which

However, the channels that are \textit{negatively-relevant} (NR) to predictions

excessive denoising or purification by integrating the opposite adversarial
direction with reverse diffusion to push the input image further toward the
opposite adversarial direction. For the first time, we also exemplify the
pitfall of conducting AutoAttack (Rand) for diffusion-based defense methods.
Through the lens of time complexity, we examine the trade-off between the
effectiveness of adaptive attack and its computation complexity against our
defense. Experimental evaluation along with time cost analysis verifies the
effectiveness of the proposed method.","Yeh, Cheng-Han and Yu, Kuanchun and Lu, Chun-Shien",2024,,,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.16805

  Attacks",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08714v1,"Adversarial attacks optimize against models to defeat defenses. Existing
defenses are static, and stay the same once trained, even while attacks change.
We argue that models should fight back, and optimize their defenses against
attacks at test time. We propose dynamic defenses, to adapt the model and input
during testing, by defensive entropy minimization (dent). Dent alters testing,
but not training, for compatibility with existing models and train-time
defenses. Dent improves the robustness of adversarially-trained defenses and
nominally-trained models against white-box, black-box, and adaptive attacks on
CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet. In particular, dent boosts state-of-the-art defenses
by 20+ points absolute against AutoAttack on CIFAR-10 at $\epsilon_\infty$ =

  Forest",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08191v2,"Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) achieve excellent performance on many
real-world tasks, they are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. A leading
defense against such attacks is adversarial training, a technique in which a
DNN is trained to be robust to adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial
noise to its input. This procedure is effective but must be done during the
training phase. In this work, we propose Augmented Random Forest (ARF), a
simple and easy-to-use strategy for robustifying an existing pretrained DNN
without modifying its weights. For every image, we generate randomized test
time augmentations by applying diverse color, blur, noise, and geometric
transforms. Then we use the DNN's logits output to train a simple random forest
to predict the real class label. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
adversarial robustness on a diversity of white and black box attacks with
minimal compromise on the natural images' classification. We test ARF also
against numerous adaptive white-box attacks and it shows excellent results when
combined with adversarial training. Code is available at

known as adversarial attacks. In this work, we study how equipping models with
Test-time Transformation Ensembling (TTE) can work as a reliable defense
against such attacks. While transforming the input data, both at train and test
times, is known to enhance model performance, its effects on adversarial
robustness have not been studied. Here, we present a comprehensive empirical
study of the impact of TTE, in the form of widely-used image transforms, on
adversarial robustness. We show that TTE consistently improves model robustness
against a variety of powerful attacks without any need for re-training, and
that this improvement comes at virtually no trade-off with accuracy on clean
samples. Finally, we show that the benefits of TTE transfer even to the
certified robustness domain, in which TTE provides sizable and consistent
improvements.","P{\'e}rez, Juan C and Alfarra, Motasem and Jeanneret, Guillaume and Rueda, Laura and Thabet, Ali and Ghanem, Bernard and Arbel{\'a}ez, Pablo",2021,,,,

on linear response theory (LRT) is described. It is pointed out that, although
the LRT theory of SR is by definition restricted to the small signal limit, it
possesses substantial advantages in terms of simplicity, generality and
predictive power. The application of LRT to overdamped motion in a bistable
potential, the most commonly studied form of SR, is outlined. Two new forms of
SR, predicted on the basis of LRT and subsequently observed in analogue
electronic experiments, are described.","Wellens, Thomas and Shatokhin, Vyacheslav and Buchleitner, Andreas",2003,,,,Reports on progress in physics

high-dimensional vectorized tokens, each corresponding to a rectangular
non-overlapping patch. This representation trades spatial granularity for
embedding dimensionality, and results in semantically rich but spatially
coarsely quantized feature maps. In order to retrieve spatial details
beneficial to fine-grained inference tasks we propose a training-free method
inspired by ""stochastic resonance"". Specifically, we perform sub-token spatial
transformations to the input data, and aggregate the resulting ViT features
after applying the inverse transformation. The resulting ""Stochastic Resonance
Transformer"" (SRT) retains the rich semantic information of the original
representation, but grounds it on a finer-scale spatial domain, partly
mitigating the coarse effect of spatial tokenization. SRT is applicable across
any layer of any ViT architecture, consistently boosting performance on several
tasks including segmentation, classification, depth estimation, and others by
up to 14.9% without the need for any fine-tuning.","Lao, Dong and Wu, Yangchao and Liu, Tian Yu and Wong, Alex and Soatto, Stefano",2024,,,,
