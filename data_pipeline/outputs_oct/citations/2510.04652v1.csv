  Evaluation",http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04085v1,"Because radio spectrum is a finite resource, its usage and sharing is
regulated by government agencies. These agencies define policies to manage
spectrum allocation and assignment across multiple organizations, systems, and
devices. With more portions of the radio spectrum being licensed for commercial
use, the importance of providing an increased level of automation when
evaluating such policies becomes crucial for the efficiency and efficacy of
spectrum management. We introduce our Dynamic Spectrum Access Policy Framework
for supporting the United States government's mission to enable both federal
and non-federal entities to compatibly utilize available spectrum. The DSA
Policy Framework acts as a machine-readable policy repository providing policy
management features and spectrum access request evaluation. The framework
utilizes a novel policy representation using OWL and PROV-O along with a
domain-specific reasoning implementation that mixes GeoSPARQL, OWL reasoning,
and knowledge graph traversal to evaluate incoming spectrum access requests and
explain how applicable policies were used. The framework is currently being
used to support live, over-the-air field exercises involving a diverse set of
federal and commercial radios, as a component of a prototype spectrum
management system.","Santos, Henrique and Mulvehill, Alice and Erickson, John S. and McCusker, Jamie P. and Gordon, Minor and Xie, Owen and Stouffer, Samuel and Capraro, Gerard and Pidwerbetsky, Alex and Burgess, John and Berlinsky, Allan and Turck, Kurt and Ashdown, Jonathan and McGuinness, Deborah L.",2020,,,,
