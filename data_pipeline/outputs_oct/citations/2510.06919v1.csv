high-dimensional data in an unsupervised manner. Our proposed method casts
alignment learning in a framework where both alignment and data are modelled
simultaneously. Further, we automatically infer groupings of different types of
sequences within the same dataset. We derive a probabilistic model built on
non-parametric priors that allows for flexible warps while at the same time
providing means to specify interpretable constraints. We demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach with superior quantitative performance to the
state-of-the-art approaches and provide examples to illustrate the versatility
of our model in automatic inference of sequence groupings, absent from previous
approaches, as well as easy specification of high level priors for different
modalities of data.","Kazlauskaite, Ieva and Ek, Carl Henrik and Campbell, Neill",2019,,,,

providing a complete mechanistic specification of the process while retaining
the flexibility to handle those situations in which data is sparse relative to
model complexity, or a full specification is hard to motivate. Latent force
models achieve this dual aim by specifying a parsimonious linear evolution
equation which an additive latent Gaussian process (GP) forcing term. In this
work we extend the latent force framework to allow for multiplicative
interactions between the GP and the latent states leading to more control over
the geometry of the trajectories. Unfortunately inference is no longer
straightforward and so we introduce an approximation based on the method of
successive approximations and examine its performance using a simulation study.","Álvarez, Mauricio and Luengo, David and Lawrence, Neil D.",2009,,,,

Gaussian Process (GP) and the Dirichlet Process (DP). Our innovation in the GP
model is to introduce a variation on the GP prior which enables us to model
structured time-series data, i.e. data containing groups where we wish to model
inter- and intra-group variability. Our innovation in the DP model is an
implementation of a new fast collapsed variational inference procedure which
enables us to optimize our variationala pproximation significantly faster than
standard VB approaches. In a biological time series application we show how our
model better captures salient features of the data, leading to better
consistency with existing biological classifications, while the associated
inference algorithm provides a twofold speed-up over EM-based variational
inference.","Hensman, James and Rattray, Magnus and Lawrence, Neil D.",2015,,,10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2318711,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence

with non-parametric components. In this article, we shall show how LFMs can be
equivalently formulated and solved using the state variable approach. We shall
also show how the Gaussian process prior used in LFMs can be equivalently
formulated as a linear statespace model driven by a white noise process and how
inference on the resulting model can be efficiently implemented using Kalman
filter and smoother. Then we shall show how the recently proposed switching LFM
can be reformulated using the state variable approach, and how we can construct
a probabilistic model for the switches by formulating a similar switching LFM
as a switching linear dynamic system (SLDS). We illustrate the performance of
the proposed methodology in simulated scenarios and apply it to inferring the
switching points in GPS data collected from car movement data in urban
environment.","Hartikainen, Jouni and Särkkä, Simo",2011,,,,
