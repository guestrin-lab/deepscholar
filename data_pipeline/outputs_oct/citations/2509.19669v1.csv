  Networks",http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11120v1,"As the commercial use of 5G technologies has grown more prevalent, smart
vehicles have become an efficient platform for delivering a wide array of
services directly to customers. The vehicular crowdsourcing service (VCS), for
example, can provide immediate and timely feedback to the user regarding
real-time transportation information. However, different sources can generate
spurious information towards a specific service request in the pursuit of
profit. Distinguishing trusted information from numerous sources is the key to
a reliable VCS platform. This paper proposes a solution to this problem called
""RC-chain"", a reputation-based crowdsourcing framework built on a blockchain
platform (Hyperledger Fabric). We first establish the blockchain-based platform
to support the management of crowdsourcing trading and user-reputation
evaluating activities. A reputation model, the Trust Propagation \& Feedback
Similarity (TPFS), then calculates the reputation values of participants and
reveals any malicious behavior accordingly. Finally, queueing theory is used to
evaluate the blockchain-based platform and optimize the system performance. The
proposed framework was deployed on the IBM Hyperledger Fabric platform to
observe its real-world running time, effectiveness, and overall performance.",,,,,,
