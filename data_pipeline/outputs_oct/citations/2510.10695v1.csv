  Stock Movement Prediction",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07400v2,"Advances in deep neural network (DNN) architectures have enabled new
prediction techniques for stock market data. Unlike other multivariate
time-series data, stock markets show two unique characteristics: (i)
\emph{multi-order dynamics}, as stock prices are affected by strong
non-pairwise correlations (e.g., within the same industry); and (ii)
\emph{internal dynamics}, as each individual stock shows some particular
behaviour. Recent DNN-based methods capture multi-order dynamics using
hypergraphs, but rely on the Fourier basis in the convolution, which is both
inefficient and ineffective. In addition, they largely ignore internal dynamics
by adopting the same model for each stock, which implies a severe information
loss.
  In this paper, we propose a framework for stock movement prediction to
overcome the above issues. Specifically, the framework includes temporal
generative filters that implement a memory-based mechanism onto an LSTM network
in an attempt to learn individual patterns per stock. Moreover, we employ
hypergraph attentions to capture the non-pairwise correlations. Here, using the
wavelet basis instead of the Fourier basis, enables us to simplify the message
passing and focus on the localized convolution. Experiments with US market data
over six years show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of profit and stability. Our source code and data are available at

Stock Prediction via a Dual Relation Fusion Network incorporating Static and Dynamic Relations,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10695v1,li2024master,\cite{li2024master},MASTER: Market-Guided Stock Transformer for Stock Price Forecasting,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15235v1,"Stock price forecasting has remained an extremely challenging problem for
many decades due to the high volatility of the stock market. Recent efforts
have been devoted to modeling complex stock correlations toward joint stock
price forecasting. Existing works share a common neural architecture that
learns temporal patterns from individual stock series and then mixes up
temporal representations to establish stock correlations. However, they only
consider time-aligned stock correlations stemming from all the input stock
features, which suffer from two limitations. First, stock correlations often
occur momentarily and in a cross-time manner. Second, the feature effectiveness
is dynamic with market variation, which affects both the stock sequential
patterns and their correlations. To address the limitations, this paper
introduces MASTER, a MArkert-Guided Stock TransformER, which models the
momentary and cross-time stock correlation and leverages market information for
automatic feature selection. MASTER elegantly tackles the complex stock
correlation by alternatively engaging in intra-stock and inter-stock
information aggregation. Experiments show the superiority of MASTER compared
with previous works and visualize the captured realistic stock correlation to
provide valuable insights.","Li, Tong and Liu, Zhaoyang and Shen, Yanyan and Wang, Xue and Chen, Haokun and Huang, Sen",2024,,,,
