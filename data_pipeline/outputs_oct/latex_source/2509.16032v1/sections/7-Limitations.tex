\section{Limitations}
We used a robotic object designed as a service table, which limits generalization. The effect of height should be further examined across different robotic morphologies. Second, the interaction was brief and simple. Factors such as the interaction’s content, emotional tone, and the robot’s functionality may also influence its social outcomes. Future studies should also explore additional design characteristics (e.g., color, form, material), broader height variations, and the impact of the robot's relative height. Additionally, we did not examine whether the effect persists over time, highlighting the need to test for potential habituation. Lastly, we followed a strict protocol to mitigate influences related to “good subject effect” in the interviews \cite{nichols2008good}.
