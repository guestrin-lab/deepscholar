\section{Conclusion}
We examined the impact of a non-humanoid robotic object's height on participants' compliance with the robot's request. As in human-human interactions, our results show that a robot’s height can have a significant social impact. However, when the robot lacks a humanoid form, this effect may follow a pattern opposite to that observed in human-human interactions. We highlight the need for robot designers and practitioners to consider their robots' characteristics and how these shape their social impact.
