	abstract = {This chapter examines whether interface factors that contribute to presence also affect players’ perceived performance in the TRUST game. The Code of Everand game was made available from November 2009 to November 2011, accessible through a player embedded within a web page. The TRUST game idea was developed during a two-day hackathon sponsored by the VoiceYourView project. In computer games, both forms of presence may contribute to the player experience, through interaction with other remotely located players or non-player characters, and through the illusion of playing in an imaginary world or simulated space. What constitutes the performance of game players is, on one level, dependent upon the goals and desired outcomes of the game. The analytical methods used are a correlation matrix, used to analyze all the responses, and parallel coordinates used on responses to questions identified from the correlation matrix for further visualization.},

They have seen some investigation in the context of games, but despite their prevalence in non-game software applications, their nature within this context is less clear. We perform a qualitative, investigative analysis of Easter eggs in non-game software application contexts, using primarily archival research including discussion forums, social media posts, and user-created online databases, along with select developer interviews. Our work uncovers the stories behind, motivations for creating, and intended perceptions of Easter eggs, which we present as categories of purposes with illustrative examples. This analysis also informs a categorization and discussion of processes that Easter eggs undergo concerning the social and emotional circumstances of their developers and users. Finally, we use our results to motivate future directions for applying Easter eggs in user interfaces.},

Three main aspects are addressed: 1) the ability to allow therapists to create new exercises and therapy programs intuitively by direct demonstration, 2) automatic therapy delivery and monitoring with the use of an autonomous virtual tutor that can monitor and quantitatively assess the motions performed by the patient, and 3) networked collaborative remote therapy sessions via connected applications displaying the motions of both the therapist and the patient. We also provide 3D assessment tools for monitoring changes in the range of motion, and for allowing the visualization of a number of properties during or after the execution of exercises. The presented system has been implemented for a low-cost hardware solution based on Kinect and for a high-end immersive virtual reality facility.},

Building upon theories related to the sublime and embodiment, we designed three VR scenes to evaluate the effectiveness of sublime and embodied design elements in invoking awe experiences. We conducted a within-subject study involving 28 young adults who experienced the three VR designs. Results demonstrated that the VR design with sublime elements significantly elicited more intense awe experiences compared to the one without, while adding embodied elements did not enhance the intensity of awe. Qualitative interviews revealed critical design elements (e.g., the obscure event should be reasonable) and their underlying mechanisms (e.g., leading to feelings of enlightenment) in invoking awe experiences. We further discuss considerations and implications for the design of effective awe-inspiring VR applications.},

	abstract = {Avatars are extensions of users' identities in virtual environments (VEs), yielding substantial influence over self-perception, affect, and behavior. However, extant research has largely focused on the implications associated with creating, and interacting with, avatars representing desirable aspects of the self (ideal self), overlooking other aspects of the self. Across several studies I examine the psychological and emotional effects of (a) creating avatars representing anxiety within the user (anxious self), and (b) interacting with such “anxiety avatars”. Results from three experiments consistently show that creating, and subsequently destroying, an anxiety avatar in various contexts reduces anxiety, effects explained by self-discrepancy theory's self-regulatory mechanisms. Follow-up studies examine interactions with anxiety avatars in custom-created PC and VR games to identify other potential mechanisms, unique to immersive VEs, contributing to these outcomes. Preliminary results support conclusions from the initial studies. Herein, I review pertinent literature, discuss findings, and outline ongoing experiments.},

However, a nature trip is not always possible, and there is a lack of evidence showing how these beneficial experiences can be replicated in Virtual Reality (VR). In response, we recruited (N=24) participants to explore a virtual mountain landscape in a within-subjects study with different levels of exertion: walking, using a chairlift, and teleporting. We found that physical exertion when walking produced significantly more positive emotions and mindfulness than other conditions. Our research shows that physically demanding outdoor activities in VR can be beneficial for the user and that the achievement of hiking up a virtual mountain on a treadmill positively impacts wellbeing. We demonstrate how physical exertion can be used to add mindfulness and positive affect to VR experiences and discuss consequences for VR designers.},

The interactions, dimensions, physics can all be based on naturalistic principles. Extended Reality (XR) is a key element of spatial computing that includes Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR) and Augmented Reality (AR). Due to the potential of creation of realistic virtual world, healthcare applications that are gamified have come into light. Visual function testing is one of the applications which has a scope for designing a gamified testing in XR for the users’ portable eye testing at comfort of their home. However, a significant gap exists in the designing and understanding of these applications. This study examines 59 research papers discussing visual function testing and gamification in XR. The corpus has been reviewed for the devices used, accuracy obtained compared to gold standards, usability and game mechanics. Based on these, this review discusses the design consideration needed in developing a gamified XR visual function testing application to enhance the accuracy and engagement of the testing in the users.},

For this, we developed a musician-centred VR system, featuring various acoustic and visual virtual environments, VR Rehearse \& Perform, based on design requirements gathered with musicians and performance experts. To investigate how VR can be designed to support music-makers in their creative musical practice, we performed iterative tests with 19 musicians followed by semi-structured interviews. Our findings suggest that VR has the potential to support different aspects of the creative musical practice, such as rehearsing, performing and improvising. Our research provides insights and inspirations toward designing musician-centred VR experiences for various musical activities.},

Extended Reality technologies offer a promising solution by providing immersive, remote therapeutic experiences that can reduce stigma and improve accessibility. In this paper, we explore the development of innovative Mixed Reality therapeutic strategies for Emotional Regulation. By examining the design process of a gamified therapeutic activity, we focus on understanding the relationship between thoughts, emotions, and behaviours. The immersive therapeutic activity presented in this paper facilitates emotion identification and regulation using visual metaphors and the externalisation of emotions, such as writing thoughts in the air, identifying which kind of emotions evokes on us, and then, disposing them. We present the results of a user study conducted with mental health professionals and patients to evaluate the efficacy and usability of the proposed therapeutic intervention. Our results inform the design and development of Mixed Reality therapeutic activities for emotional regulation, highlighting the importance of natural and intuitive interaction methods that leverage gesture recognition to enhance user engagement and therapeutic efficacy. This study also underscores the potential of Mixed Reality to positively influence emotional regulation and suggests future directions for incorporating personalised and multimodal elements to further enrich therapeutic experiences.},

The general inductive approach provides an easily used and systematic set of procedures for analyzing qualitative data that can produce reliable and valid findings. Although the general inductive approach is not as strong as some other analytic strategies for theory or model development, it does provide a simple, straightforward approach for deriving findings in the context of focused evaluation questions.

We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis.

In contemporary psychology, mindfulness is often similarly conceptualized as a trait or a state characterized by two components: attention of physical/bodily and mental present-moment experience (i.e., what experience a person attends to) and a mental attitude characterized by curiosity and acceptance of present-moment experience (i.e., how a person attends to experience; Bishop SR, Lau M, Shapiro S, Carlson L, Anderson ND, Carmody J, Devins G. Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice; Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice 11:230–241, 2004; Lindsay EK, Creswell JD. Clinical Psychology Review 51:48–59, 2017). Integrating these canonical and contemporary theoretical perspectives, Tanay and Bernstein (Psychological Assessment 25:1286–1299, 2013) developed the State Mindfulness Scale (SMS). The SMS is a 21-item self-report measure designed to assess state mindfulness. More specifically, the SMS is designed to quantify subjective levels of present-moment attention to and awareness of two domains of experiential events or objects of which one may be mindful, bodily sensations and mental events, during a specific period of time (e.g., past 15 min) and context (e.g., mindfulness meditation or other activity). In this chapter, we review the theoretical foundations, development, initial validation, and subsequent psychometric study of the SMS. We also describe the SMS administration and scoring, and briefly, the limitations and possible next steps for the psychometric study of the SMS and the measurement of state mindfulness more broadly.},

To accomplish this, it is necessary to understand the composition of this construct and how to evaluate it. Building on previous work that posited a theory of engagement and identified a core set of attributes that operationalized this construct, we constructed and evaluated a multidimensional scale to measure user engagement. In this paper we describe the development of the scale, as well as two large-scale studies (N=440 and N=802) that were undertaken to assess its reliability and validity in online shopping environments. In the first we used Reliability Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis to identify six attributes of engagement: Perceived Usability, Aesthetics, Focused Attention, Felt Involvement, Novelty, and Endurability. In the second we tested the validity of and relationships among those attributes using Structural Equation Modeling. The result of this research is a multidimensional scale that may be used to test the engagement of software applications. In addition, findings indicate that attributes of engagement are highly intertwined, a complex interplay of user-system interaction variables. Notably, Perceived Usability played a mediating role in the relationship between Endurability and Novelty, Aesthetics, Felt Involvement, and Focused Attention.},

Cardiovascular data and saliva cortisol were collected. Repeated ANOVA measurements indicated parasympathetic activation in the group subjected to sounds of nature in a virtual natural environment, suggesting enhanced stress recovery may occur in such surroundings. The group that recovered in virtual nature without sound and the control group displayed no particular autonomic activation or deactivation. The results demonstrate a potential mechanistic link between nature, the sounds of nature, and stress recovery, and suggest the potential importance of virtual reality as a tool in this research field.},

Therapists have increasingly incorporated mindfulness-based VR meditation systems into their interventions to treat a wide range of psychological conditions, however the effectiveness of mindfulness based VR meditation systems is still unproven. We propose that visualization based meditation presented in VR will have greater efficacy for the improvement of psychological well-being than mindfulness based VR meditation. We base this on the hypothesis that the visual affordances of VR and the arousal of the autonomic nervous system it produces through the phenomenon of virtual presence, links the technology directly with visualization based meditation techniques found in Buddhism which also induce arousal in the body. We have designed a pilot study where participants practice a Buddhist visualization meditation technique using our arousal-based VR neurofeedback system, while a control group will experience a VR mindfulness system. We hypothesize that the visualization based VR experience will have greater efficacy for improving psychological well-being than the mindfulness based systems.},

	abstract = {Recent VR head-mounted displays for consumers feature 3-DOF or 6-DOF head tracking. However, position tracking (when available) is limited to a small area. Moreover, in small or cluttered physical spaces, users can safely experience VR only by staying in place, standing or seated. Different locomotion techniques have been proposed to allow users to explore virtual environments by staying in place. Two in-place locomotion techniques, frequently employed in the literature and in consumer applications, are based on joystick and teleport. Some authors explored leaning with the aim of proposing a more natural in-place locomotion technique. However, more research is needed to understand the effects of the three techniques, since no user study thoroughly compared them all together on a variety of fundamental aspects. Therefore, this paper presents a comparative evaluation with 75 users, assessing the effects of the three techniques on performance, sickness, presence, usability, and different aspects of comfort. Performance of teleport was better than the other techniques, and performance of leaning was better than joystick. Teleport also caused less nausea than the other techniques. Unexpectedly, no significant differences were found for presence. Teleport received a higher usability score than the other techniques. Finally, the techniques had different effects on comfort that we discuss in detail.},

To address these gaps, this paper examines the current landscape of XR TETs by creating a database of 176 different techniques.

Virtual reality (VR) games have the potential to overcome this because they are fun and also can be physically demanding. This paper explores whether a VR game studio can help workers in sedentary jobs to get valuable levels of exercise. We studied how 11 participants used our VR game studio in a sedentary workplace over 8-weeks and their perceptions of the experience. We analysed the physical exertion in the VR game studio, comparing this to their step counts from a smartwatch. All participants achieved valuable levels of physical activity and mood benefits. Importantly, for 6 participants, only with the VR game studio did they meet recommended activity levels. Our key contributions are insights about the use of a workplace VR game studio and its health benefits.},

Assuming that emotional- and self-regulation are processes underlying the development of place identity, and that a person's favorite place is an exemplar of environments used in such regulation processes, the present study goes beyond preliminary observations about restorative aspects of favorite places to consider how individuals evaluate their favorite places using terms set out in restorative environments theory. Finnish university students (n=78) evaluated the central square of their city (Tampere) and favorite and unpleasant places of their own designation using the Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS), an instrument based on attention restoration theory. Consistent with notions of self-regulation, PRS subscale scores for Being Away, Fascination, Coherence, and Compatibility were all high in the favorite place evaluations, but Coherence and Compatibility were reliably higher than Being Away, which was in turn reliably higher than Fascination. Also, PRS subscale scores for the favorite places were reliably higher than those for the central square, which were in turn higher than those for the unpleasant places. Furthermore, differences were also found in self-reported emotional states associated with each place. The discussion suggests ways to develop further mutually reinforcing relations between restorative environments research and research on place identity.},

	abstract     = {Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) training offers the capability to industrial workers to acquire skills and address complex tasks by immersing them in a safe and controlled virtual environment (VE). However, in the literature, IVR training is mainly based on principles of standardization and efficiency without considering the operators’ well-being. A novel design approach consists of the introduction in the VE of Positive Computing to improve workers’ well-being by applying the Biophilia hypothesis. In this work, we explored the possibility of introducing biophilic elements in a VE training scenario that would support psychological well-being and human potential. However, the introduction of virtual elements not related to the training task may distract operators, impairing their performance. We selected as a training scenario the assembly of a real truck engine. It is accomplished in a workstation, and operators do not interact with the surrounding VE. Therefore, we placed the training area into four different types of VEs: 3D Minimal (MIN), 3D Minimal Biophilic enriched (MIN+BIO), 3D Realistic (REAL), and 3D Realistic Biophilic enriched (REAL+BIO). We compared the MIN and REAL scenarios with the respective biophilic enriched scenarios. The performance of 40 participants was evaluated in terms of completion time, object fixation time, training task accuracy, knowledge accuracy, cognitive load, and user experience. The results revealed that introducing biophilic elements in a VR training environment attracts users’ attention in the idle phase of the training. In contrast, they keep concentrating on the task without worsening their performance during the task accomplishment.},

	abstract     = {People base many decisions on affective forecasts, predictions about their emotional reactions to future events. They often display an impact bias, overestimating the intensity and duration of their emotional reactions to such events. One cause of the impact bias is focalism, the tendency to underestimate the extent to which other events will influence our thoughts and feelings. Another is people's failure to anticipate how quickly they will make sense of things that happen to them in a way that speeds emotional recovery. This is especially true when predicting reactions to negative events: People fail to anticipate how quickly they will cope psychologically with such events in ways that speed their recovery from them. Several implications are discussed, such as the tendency for people to attribute their unexpected resilience to external agents.},

	abstract     = {Although virtual reality (VR) is increasingly regarded as an effective emotion induction technique, little research has examined whether and how emotions elicited in VR differ from those evoked in real life. To address this question, 50 participants (25 females and 25 males) were exposed to either a real-life contemplative scenario (a panoramic view of a lake) or to an immersive 360° footage of the same landscape. Next, type and valence of emotions, as well as sense of presence reported by participants, were compared across conditions. Findings showed that emotions elicited by virtual and natural conditions were not significantly different. The only exception was anger, which was significantly higher in the natural condition, and amusement, which was significantly higher in the virtual condition. Sense of physical presence and engagement dimensions of presence did not significantly differ between virtual and real conditions. However, different correlation patterns between emotions and key dimensions of presence were found after in vivo and in virtuo exposure. These findings provide initial evidence that emotions and sense of presence elicited by immersive videos are comparable with those evoked by real-life scenarios and warrant further investigations.}

	abstract     = {Nature exposure in virtual reality (VR) can provide emotional well-being benefits for people who cannot access the outdoors. Little is known about how these simulated experiences compare with real outdoor experiences. We conduct an experiment with healthy undergraduate students that tests the effects of 6 min of outdoor nature exposure with 6 min of exposure to a 360-degree VR nature video, which is recorded at the outdoor nature exposure location. Skin conductivity, restorativeness, and mood before and after exposure are measured. We find that both types of nature exposure increase physiological arousal, benefit positive mood levels, and are restorative compared to an indoor setting without nature; however, for outdoor exposure, positive mood levels increase and for virtual nature, they stay the same. The nature-based experience shows benefits above and beyond the variance explained by participants’ preferences, nature and VR experiences, and demographic characteristics. Settings where people have limited access to nature might consider using VR nature experiences to promote mental health.},

	abstract = {Although research has found that long-term mindfulness meditation practice promotes executive functioning and the ability to sustain attention, the effects of brief mindfulness meditation training have not been fully explored. We examined whether brief meditation training affects cognition and mood when compared to an active control group. After four sessions of either meditation training or listening to a recorded book, participants with no prior meditation experience were assessed with measures of mood, verbal fluency, visual coding, and working memory. Both interventions were effective at improving mood but only brief meditation training reduced fatigue, anxiety, and increased mindfulness. Moreover, brief mindfulness training significantly improved visuo-spatial processing, working memory, and executive functioning. Our findings suggest that 4days of meditation training can enhance the ability to sustain attention; benefits that have previously been reported with long-term meditators.},
