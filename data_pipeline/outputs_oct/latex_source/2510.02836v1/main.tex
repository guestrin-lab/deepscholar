\abstract{Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly being used to support workplace well-being, but many interventions focus narrowly on a single activity or goal. Our work explores how VR can meet the diverse physical and mental needs of knowledge workers. We developed Tranquil Loom, a VR app offering stretching, guided meditation, and open exploration across four environments. The app includes an AI assistant that suggests activities based on users’ emotional states. We conducted a two-phase mixed-methods study: (1) interviews with 10 knowledge workers to guide the app’s design, and (2) deployment with 35 participants gathering usage data, well-being measures, and interviews. Results showed increases in mindfulness and reductions in anxiety. Participants enjoyed both structured and open-ended activities, often using the app playfully. While AI suggestions were used infrequently, they prompted ideas for future personalization. Overall, participants viewed VR as a flexible, ``drop-in'' tool, highlighting its value for situational rather than prescriptive well-being support.} %\todo{1. check throughout the paper for the word/phrase "on demand" if so, remove it. 2. normalize the use of "app", "tool", "application", "system". 3. write everything in American English}



%% LONGER VERSION
% Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly explored as a tool for workplace well-being, yet many interventions focus on a single activity or wellness goal. In this study, we explored how VR can be designed to support the varying physical, mental, and cognitive needs of knowledge workers. We developed Tranquil Loom, which is a multi-activity VR app that offers short sessions of yoga, guided meditation, and open exploration across four calming environments. We conducted a two-phase mixed-methods study: \emph{1)} semi-structured interviews with 10 knowledge workers to inform the app's design, and \emph{2)} a workplace deployment with 35 participants that combined usage data, pre-post well-being measures, and follow-up interviews. Our results showed significant increases in mindfulness and reductions in anxiety after using Tranquil Loom. Surprisingly, open-ended exploration was as popular as structured wellness activities, with our participants embracing playful and self-directed use. Rather than viewing VR as a routine wellness tool, participants described it as a ``drop-in'' option for short breaks, suggesting that future designs should support spontaneous and situational use without prescribing fixed goals or paths.



% VR is gaining traction as a workplace well-being tool, yet most interventions offer narrow solutiong, focusing on either relaxation, movement, or focus, and overlook the varied and shifting needs of knowledge workers. To explore how VR can support physical, mental, and cognitive well-being in more flexible ways, we conducted a two-phase mixed-methods study. In the first phase, we interviewed ten knowledge workers to understand their break-taking habits, wellness goals, and attitudes toward VR. The insights informed the design of Tranquil Loom, a multi-activity VR app offering short sessions of yoga, guided meditation, and open-ended nature exploration, within four calming environments. In the second phase,  we introduced the app in a workplace setting and tested it with 35 participants, using it as a design probe to explore how different experiences met users’ needs. We measured state mindfulness and anxiety before and after, tracked user engagement, and conducted semi-structured interviews. 
% %or We assessed changes in mindfulness and anxiety, alongside usage patterns and user reflections.
% Mindfulness increased and anxiety decreased overall. Participants imagined VR as a drop-in tool for short, ad-hoc breaks, raising design implications around balancing doing and being, personalisation, and play.

% Knowledge workers often face stress, physical inactivity, and limited opportunities for restorative breaks during the workday. While Virtual Reality (VR) has shown potential to support workplace well-being, most existing interventions target a single wellness need, overlooking the diverse and situational challenges faced by workers. In this study, we aimed to better understand how VR can be designed to support the varied well-being needs of knowledge workers. We first conducted semi-structured interviews with ten knowledge workers to explore their everyday needs and attitudes towards VR. Insights from these interviews informed the development of Tranquil Loom, a multi-functional VR app offering short activities: yoga, guided meditation, and open exploration, across four calming virtual environments. We then introduced the app in a workplace setting with 35 participants, using it as a design probe to explore how different experiences met users’ needs.  Our findings offer practical design considerations for creating flexible, context-aware VR wellness tools that fit into the flow of knowledge work.

% previous works on VR for knowledge workers focused on a specific wellness need or in a single type of intervention. 

% However, this does not account to the individual needs of the speficic population of knowledge workers. 

% we need to understand their needs and what features and how to design such an app.
