\subsection{Metrics}

Determining whether code generated by an LLM is correct can be formulated as a binary classification problem. 
To evaluate \tool and the baseline methods, we employ standard classification metrics. 
%
For a fair evaluation across both classes, especially in the presence of class imbalance, we adopt weighted metrics including \textit{Accuracy}, \textit{Weighted Precision}, \textit{Weighted Recall}, and \textit{Weighted F1-Score}.
%
These metrics compute a label-wise average weighted by the proportion of each class in the test set.
%
We also evaluate the efficiency of each approach by measuring time complexity (for both training and inference) and memory usage. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the practical feasibility of the approaches.
