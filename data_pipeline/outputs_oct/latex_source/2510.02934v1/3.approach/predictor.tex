\subsection{Code Correctness Predictor}
\label{sec:predictor}

% To enable efficient and generalizable correctness classification, 
In \textit{Code Correctness Predictor},
\tool transforms the set weighted representations  $\mathcal{Z}^* = \{z_{l,i}\}$ into a single, fixed-length vector of representation. Specifically, it aggregates all the weighted representations in $\mathcal{Z}^*$ into a unified vector $z \in \mathbb{R}^d$ as follows:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:representation_aggregation}
    z = \text{aggregate}(\mathcal{Z}^*)
\end{equation}
%
Without loss of generality, the aggregation function $aggregate$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:representation_aggregation} could be implemented using various strategies such as concatenation, summation, mean/max pooling, etc. The impact of different aggregation methods is empirically evaluated in Sec.~\ref{sec:impact_aggregation_classifier}. 

The aggregated vector $z$ is then fed into a probing classifier that predicts the correctness label of the corresponding code $c$. The probing classifier can be implemented as either a simple neural network or a linear model.
It is trained end-to-end with the selector using standard supervised learning. 
The influence of different classifier architectures on prediction performance is also evaluated in Sec.~\ref{sec:impact_aggregation_classifier}.
