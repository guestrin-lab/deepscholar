\begin{gtheorem} 
\textbf{Answer to RQ2}: Each component of \tool effectively contributes to its overall performance and robustness. Within the internal representation extractor, compact and structured subsets of internal states, which are obtained through suitable token and layer sampling strategies, significantly improve efficiency without sacrificing predictive accuracy. 
The informative representation selector and the max pooling aggregation function further enhance performance by capturing the most salient features from the selected representations. 
Finally, gradient-based classifiers such as Logistic Regression and MLP are well-suited for integration into \tool's joint training framework.
