\subsubsection{Impact of Informative Representation Selector}

\input{tables/tab_intrinsic_selector}
Table~\ref{tab:intrinsic_selector} illustrates that \textit{the informative representation selector module significantly contributes to \tool's performance}. 
Indeed, not all internal representations contribute equally to correctness prediction. Without a mechanism to identify and prioritize useful signals, the classifier struggles to capture important information.
By incorporating an attention mechanism to assign higher weights to the important representations and downweight the irrelevant ones, \tool's F1-Score in code correctness prediction improves from 0.69 to 0.76 (more than 10\% relatively). 
The selector module thus plays a crucial role in directing the model's focus toward the most relevant internal states, leading to more effective and reliable correctness assessment.

Moreover, since the attention scores are jointly trained with the probing classifier, the training time remains comparable with and without the selector module.
This suggests that the performance improvement comes at a reasonable computational cost, making the selector a lightweight yet useful addition to the \tool's design.
