\section{Evaluation Methodology}

%research questions
To evaluate the performance of \tool, we seek to answer the following research questions:

\noindent \textbf{RQ1. Performance Analysis:} How effective is \tool in assessing the correctness of code generated by different code LLMs compared to SOTA methods?

\noindent \textbf{RQ2. Intrinsic Analysis:} How do different components of \tool contribute to its overall performance?


\noindent \textbf{RQ3. Sensitivity Analysis:}  How sensitive is \tool's performance to different external factors such as programming languages, code LLMs, and training data sizes?

\noindent \textbf{RQ4. Efficiency Analysis:} How is \tool's time complexity and memory usage?
