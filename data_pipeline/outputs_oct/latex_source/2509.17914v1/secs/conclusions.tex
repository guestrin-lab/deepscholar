\toolname{} Source and Intermediate Representation (IR) containers bring a new methodology for software management in HPC.
%
We show that changing the software distribution allows for delaying performance critical decisions until the deployment, avoiding performance limitations of traditional containers.

Our prototype demonstrates that software deployments based on LLVM IR can significantly reduce the number of files that need to be generated without sacrificing performance.
