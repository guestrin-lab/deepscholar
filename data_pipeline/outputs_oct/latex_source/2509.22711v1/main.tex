\begin{abstract}
  Partisan bias in LLMs has been evaluated to assess political leanings, typically through a broad lens and largely in Western contexts. We move beyond identifying general leanings to examine harmful, adversarial representational associations around political leaders and parties. To do so, we create datasets \textit{NeutQA-440} (non-adversarial prompts) and \textit{AdverQA-440} (adversarial prompts), which probe models for comparative plausibility judgments across the USA and India. Results show high susceptibility to biased partisan associations and pronounced asymmetries (e.g., substantially more favorable associations for U.S. Democrats than Republicans) alongside mixed-polarity concentration around India's BJP, highlighting systemic risks and motivating standardized, cross-cultural evaluation.

% \section{Introduction}
% % \input{contents/introduction}
% The exponential rise, enhancement, and integration of LLMs in everyday life warrant a continuous and careful evaluation of these models to ensure the timely identification of any harmful behaviour. Large language models exhibiting bias is one example of how models' behavior can have unintended and potentially detrimental effects if left unchecked \cite{Gallegos2024, ranjan2024comprehensivesurveybiasllms}. 
% \\
% Bias can manifest across various domains and axes, in multiple forms, and in several distinct types of text generation \cite{dong2023probingexplicitimplicitgender, Huang10.1145/3724117, lim2024africanwomanrhythmicsoulful, soundararajan-delany-2024-investigating, Fang2024}. Among these different types, model outputs can exhibit bias in ideologies and reflect skewed political leanings \cite{Peng2024, Fisher2025}. Such biased leanings cannot be considered mere technical glitches, as they can perpetuate stereotypes and representational harm. Partisan bias or political bias can be defined \textit{as the tendency of political partisans to process information and make judgments in a way that favors their own party or political ideology} \cite{Fisher2025}. 
% \\
% Previous works have studied partisan bias to uncover and highlight models' skewness and political attitude on a left-to-right-wing spectrum by evaluating them using curated political statements \cite{feng-etal-2023-pretraining, wright-etal-2024-llm, Faulborn2025, röttger2024politicalcompassspinningarrow}. Questionnaires like the Political Compass Test (PCT) \cite{PoliticalCompassTest}, European Values Study (EVS), and World Values Survey (WVS) Joint Questionnaire \cite{JointQuestionnaire} are some that have been used to define and collect the statements corpus \cite{Faulborn2025}. Additionally, current research on partisan bias in LLMs is often centred around Western politics \cite{Faulborn2025, Motoki2025, Yangetal, rozado2025measuringpoliticalpreferencesai, Rettenberger2025}, and hence falls short in providing a clear picture of non-Western political scenarios.
% \\
% In this work, we aim to go beyond identifying a specific political leaning of an LLM and assess the outputs through a more critical lens of levels of adversarial generalizations and harmful representation due to that leaning. By creating a hierarchical, 3-level structure of 11 themes, 44 topics, and identity attributes, we designed \textbf{\textit{AdverQA-440}}. AdverQA-440 is a dataset consisting of 440 pairs of adversarial statements around political leaders and political parties, followed by a logical plausibility question that is posed to the model. 
% \\
% Using the dataset, we evaluate how 6 frontier models tend to represent and associate political entities. We then compare the adversarial data to a baseline dataset, \textbf{\textit{NeutQA-440}}, which comprises a set of 440 statements, curated around topics related to more balanced, non-adversarial negative and positive descriptors for political entities. 
% This evaluation is conducted for two countries, the USA and India, to enable a more nuanced comparison of the partisan bias of models in a Western and a non-Western context and highlight differences in the political leanings of LLMs. 
\section{Introduction}
% \input{contents/introduction}
LLMs are rapidly integrated into sociotechnical workflows, making rigorous, ongoing evaluation essential to surface and mitigate harmful behaviors \cite{Gallegos2024, ranjan2024comprehensivesurveybiasllms}. Among these harms, political and partisan biases are especially consequential: they can entrench stereotypes, distort discourse, and create representational harms that extend beyond “left vs.\ right” summaries \cite{Peng2024, Fisher2025}. Prior studies typically rely on Western questionnaires or statement sets and focus on aggregate leanings \cite{feng-etal-2023-pretraining, wright-etal-2024-llm, Faulborn2025, röttger2024politicalcompassspinningarrow, PoliticalCompassTest, JointQuestionnaire}. As a result, they underrepresent non-Western contexts and rarely probe whether models make harmful, adversarial associations about specific leaders and parties \cite{Faulborn2025, Motoki2025, Yangetal, rozado2025measuringpoliticalpreferencesai, Rettenberger2025}.

We move from measuring generic leaning to auditing harmful partisan associations via comparative plausibility judgments. Concretely, we curate two compact datasets: \textit{NeutQA-440} (balanced descriptors) and \textit{AdverQA-440} (polarized adversarial actions), each pairing near-identical statements that differ only in the political entity (leaders/parties) across the USA and India. Models choose which sentence “makes more sense,” revealing directional skew under neutral vs.\ adversarial framings.

\paragraph{Contributions.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cross-cultural benchmark}: A 3-level taxonomy (themes, topics, entities) and two datasets—\textit{NeutQA-440} and \textit{AdverQA-440}—spanning leaders and parties in the USA and India.
    \item \textbf{Standardized task}: A pairwise logical-plausibility protocol with counterbalancing and refusal capture for safety-awareness.
    \item \textbf{Systematic findings across six frontier LLMs}: High susceptibility to partisan associations; strong asymmetries favoring U.S.\ Democrats over Republicans; mixed-polarity concentration for India’s BJP; and unexpectedly higher bias under neutral prompts than adversarial ones.
    \item \textbf{Implications}: Evidence that partisan associations are embedded rather than prompt-dependent, motivating cross-cultural evaluation, better data coverage, and stronger safeguards for political comparisons.
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}
% \input{contents/related work}
Partisan or political bias in LLMs has piqued researchers' interest, and several studies have evaluated the presence of this bias in various applications and frontier LLMs like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, etc. \cite{feng-etal-2023-pretraining, Yangetal, Rozado2023, Rotaru2024, yuksel2025languagedependentpoliticalbiasai}. Focusing on political bias in the American context, Motoki et al. studied the left-leaning political bias in LLMs and underscored the existing value misalignment between ChatGPT, a popular LLM application, and the average American \cite{Motoki2025}. Similarly, Faulborn et al. proposed a survey-type political bias measure grounded in political science theory and used it to test various commercial large language models, including multiple versions of ChatGPT \cite{Faulborn2025}. Going a step further from simply analysing partisan leaning, Peng et al. perform a comparative study of political bias in LLMs. They design a two-dimensional framework that assesses the political leaning of models on highly polarized topics while also assessing socio-political involvement on less polarized ones \cite{Peng2024}.

When examining the manifestations of partisan bias in different contexts, it is crucial to also highlight the well-researched effects of interacting with a politically biased LLM and how it can influence decisions and individual political ideologies. Fisher et al. conducted a study to understand whether LLMs with a specific political leaning can influence the political decision-making of individuals interacting with those models. The experiment highlights the significant extent to which interacting with a biased model leads participants to adopt opinions and make decisions that match the model's \cite{Fisher2025}. Messer, in their study, uncovered a similar pattern where perceived alignment between a user’s political orientation and bias in generated content was found to increase reliance and acceptance of Generative AI systems by the user \cite{Messer2025}.\\
Research not only highlights the pervasive influence of biased LLMs but also demonstrates their power to impact political conduct and public discourse around crucial topics. Goodman, in their thesis, further elaborates on the impact and detrimental effects of the presence of political bias in LLM applications like ChatGPT and reiterates how it can influence voting trends, especially the votes of voters with low self-confidence \cite{GoodmanFacultyAdvisor2024}.
Therefore, it becomes imperative to first understand the extent of the bias in a system and thoroughly examine the harms it is perpetuating before aiming to mitigate the bias. 



\section{Methodology}

To evaluate emergent partisan bias and representational harms in LLMs, we define a compact, reproducible 3-level partisan bias taxonomy (Appendix~\ref{app:taxonomy}; catalogs in Appendices~\ref{app:themes}–\ref{app:attributes}). The setup targets leaders and parties across India and the USA, spanning themes and non-adversarial and highly adversarial positive/negative topics under those.

\subsection{Evaluation Task}
Each final prompt pairs two near-identical statements differing only in the political entity and asks: \textit{"Which sentence is more logically plausible?"} \cite{nawale2025fairitalesevaluationfairness}. Models respond over 3 iterations per prompt. We counterbalance entity order to eliminate positional effects \cite{wang2025eliminatingpositionbiaslanguage, saito2025answerinvestigatingpositionalbias}. Refusals are recorded to capture awareness of harmful associations; among non-refusals, consistent choices reveal directional skew.

\subsection{Templates and Scaling}
We generate prompts through minimal templates with placeholders \texttt{<identity\_1>, <identity\_2>, <topic>}. Four template families (positive/negative $\times$ leaders/parties) enable scalable, consistent expansion while preserving comparability across models and contexts (Figure~\ref{fig:template}).

    \caption{Template design for the logical plausibility task}
    \label{fig:template}
\end{figure}
\section{Results}

\subsection{Evaluation Methodology}

We employed a three-step protocol to evaluate partisan bias: (i) detecting whether models recognized and refused biased prompts, (ii) identifying consistent associations and sentiment directions, and (iii) assessing potential real-world implications. The formal mathematical framework and detailed evaluation pipeline are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:extended_methods}.


\subsection{Aggregate Model Performance}

We evaluated six frontier models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude Opus, Claude Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Mistral Medium), finding consistent partisan bias patterns across all systems. Although individual model performance varied, ranging from 91.6\% to 100\% bias susceptibility, the aggregate patterns revealed systematic rather than model-specific biases. Detailed model-by-model analysis is provided in Appendix~\ref{app:model_specific}, allowing us to focus here on the robust cross-model trends that indicate fundamental challenges in political neutrality across current LLM architectures.

\subsection{Partisan Skew Patterns}

Figure \ref{fig:combined-sentiment} presents the aggregate sentiment analysis across all models, revealing stark partisan asymmetries in both datasets. The visualization demonstrates how models consistently favor certain political entities over others, with patterns that persist across both adversarial and neutral prompting conditions.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=15em, keepaspectratio]{contents/images/combined_sentiment_analysis.png}
    \caption{Combined sentiment analysis showing positive vs. negative associations for political leaders and parties across AdverQA-440 and NeutQA-440 datasets.}
    \label{fig:combined-sentiment}
\end{figure}
% \subsubsection{USA Political Landscape}

\paragraph{USA Political Landscape}\mbox{}\\
The combined analysis reveals severe partisan asymmetry:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Party-level}: Democrats received $14\times$ more positive associations than Republicans (600 vs.\ 48), while Republicans received $13\times$ more negative associations (580 vs.\ 43).
    \item \textbf{Leader-level}: Democratic leaders (Biden, Obama, Kennedy) achieved a 93.0\% positive-bias rate compared to 6.2\% for Republican leaders (Trump, Nixon, Bush).
    \item \textbf{Extreme associations}: Models readily made alarming connections, linking Republicans with ``systemic embezzlement'' and ``protecting sexual violence offenders''.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Indian Political Landscape}\mbox{}\\
Indian politics revealed more nuanced but equally concerning patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{BJP paradox}: Received both the highest positive and negative association counts, suggesting models view it as the most salient yet controversial party, specifically in \textit{AdverQA-440}.
    \item \textbf{Dangerous associations}: Models made extreme claims, associating CPIM with ``silencing whistleblowers through torture'' and INC with ``rigging elections''.
    \item \textbf{Leader dynamics}: Contemporary leaders (e.g., Modi) showed balanced sentiment, while Vajpayee received predominantly positive treatment ($>70\%$); by contrast, both Gandhis received predominantly negative treatment.
\end{itemize}
The results in Fig.~\ref{fig:combined-sentiment} indicate that partisan associations are embedded rather than prompt-dependent: models indicate bias rates of 95.0\%/92.6\% for positive/negative prompts in AdverQA-440 and 98.2\%/95.6\% in NeutQA-440, with biases concentrated in three themes around fundamental leadership traits--integrity/honesty, competence/intelligence, and vision/leadership (each $\approx 180$ biased responses). Our deliberate focus on aggregate patterns across six frontier models shows cross-model convergence despite different providers, architectures, and alignment stacks, indicating a systemic phenomenon rather than model-specific artifacts; mitigations must therefore target training data, alignment methods, and evaluation frameworks, not one-off tweaks.

These patterns pose democratic risks: a $14\times$ disparity in positive associations between parties creates information asymmetry; models mirror and can amplify echo-chamber dynamics; and a readiness to make extreme links (e.g., to ``systemic embezzlement'') during sensitive periods risks nudging voter perceptions via repeated exposure. Technically and culturally, more extreme political skew for U.S.\ (93\% vs.\ 6.2\% positive rates for opposing parties) as compared to India suggests Western-centric data dominance; higher bias under neutral prompts (98.3\%) than adversarial (96.8\%) indicates robustness failures on naturalistic queries; and concentration in core leadership traits underscores alignment limits on deeply held political associations. 

We recommend: (i) integrating partisan bias testing into standard LLM benchmarks with pre-deployment disclosure, (ii) curating balanced political corpora with strong non-Western coverage, and (iii) strengthening refusal mechanisms for partisan comparisons and extreme claims; future work should extend beyond English, probe multilingual contexts, develop real-time bias detection for deployed systems, and quantify downstream impacts on beliefs and behavior.


\section{Conclusion}
% \input{contents/conclusion}

Our analysis of 5,280 responses in six frontier LLMs reveals widespread partisan bias, with rates exceeding 91\% for all models tested. The combined sentiment analysis (Figure \ref{fig:combined-sentiment}) shows that these biases are systematic rather than random, consistent across prompting strategies, and manifest as severe asymmetries in political treatment. 
%with some parties receiving 14$\times$ more favorable coverage than others.
Most concerning is the models' willingness to make extreme, potentially defamatory associations with political entities, coupled with the finding that neutral, naturalistic prompts elicit even higher bias rates than adversarial ones. This suggests that current safety mechanisms are poorly calibrated for real-world usage patterns.

As LLMs increasingly mediate information access and shape public discourse, these partisan biases represent not just a technical failure but a threat to democratic principles of fair representation and informed choice. The consistency of these patterns across models from different organizations indicates that addressing partisan bias requires industry-wide commitment to new training paradigms, evaluation standards, and deployment safeguards. Without urgent action, AI systems risk becoming amplifiers of political division, rather than tools for informed democratic participation.

\section{Model-Specific Analysis}\label{app:model_specific}

\subsection{Individual Model Performance}

While the main paper focuses on aggregate patterns to demonstrate systemic bias, this appendix provides detailed model-by-model analysis. Table \ref{tab:model-bias-detailed} presents bias detection rates for each model across both datasets.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Model-specific bias detection rates and sentiment distributions. Perfect 50/50 sentiment splits suggest systematic rather than random bias patterns.}
\label{tab:model-bias-detailed}
\end{table}

\subsection{Model Behavioral Clusters}

Analysis revealed three distinct behavioral patterns across models:

\subsubsection{Cluster 1: Complete Susceptibility}
\textbf{Models}: GPT-4o, Mistral Large, Mistral Medium

These models showed 100\% bias rates across both datasets with perfect sentiment balance (50\% positive, 50\% negative). This pattern suggests:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No effective refusal mechanisms for political comparisons
    \item Systematic application of biases rather than random associations
    \item Consistent behavior regardless of prompt adversariality
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cluster 2: Marginal Resistance}
\textbf{Models}: Claude Sonnet, GPT-4.1

These models demonstrated slightly lower bias rates (91.6-93.6\% in AdverQA) and exhibited:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited ability to refuse some biased comparisons
    \item Slight positive sentiment skew (53-54\% positive)
    \item Variable performance between datasets for GPT-4.1
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cluster 3: Dataset-Dependent}
\textbf{Model}: Claude Opus

Claude Opus showed unique behavior:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Near-complete bias in AdverQA (99.3\%) but perfect bias in NeutQA (100\%)
    \item Balanced sentiment distribution
    \item Suggests sensitivity to prompt formulation despite high overall bias
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model-Specific Partisan Patterns}

The following subsections present detailed sentiment analysis for each model, showing how partisan biases manifest across leaders and parties in both USA and Indian contexts. Each visualization follows the same 4$\times$2 grid structure as the main paper's combined analysis, allowing direct comparison of model-specific patterns.

\subsubsection{GPT-4o Analysis}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{contents/images/model_sentiment_gpt_4o.png}
    \caption{GPT-4o sentiment analysis across political entities. This model showed 100\% bias susceptibility with perfect sentiment balance, indicating systematic rather than random associations.}
    \label{fig:gpt4o-sentiment}
\end{figure}

GPT-4o demonstrated the most extreme partisan patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{USA}: Complete polarization with Democrats receiving exclusively positive associations when chosen, Republicans exclusively negative
    \item \textbf{India}: Perfect 50/50 sentiment balance for BJP, suggesting high salience but controversial perception
    \item \textbf{Cross-dataset consistency}: Identical patterns in both AdverQA and NeutQA
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{GPT-4.1 Analysis}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{contents/images/model_sentiment_gpt_4_1.png}
    \caption{GPT-4.1 sentiment analysis. Shows moderate resistance with 91.6\% bias in AdverQA but complete susceptibility in NeutQA.}
    \label{fig:gpt41-sentiment}
\end{figure}

GPT-4.1 exhibited dataset-dependent behavior:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{USA}: Strong but not absolute Democrat preference (89\% positive vs 82\% negative for Republicans)
    \item \textbf{India}: More nuanced patterns with BJP showing slight negative skew
    \item \textbf{Dataset variation}: Lower bias in adversarial prompts, suggesting some safety mechanism activation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Claude Opus Analysis}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{contents/images/model_sentiment_claude_opus_4_20250514.png}
    \caption{Claude Opus sentiment patterns. Near-complete bias (99.3\% AdverQA, 100\% NeutQA) with balanced sentiment distribution.}
    \label{fig:claude-opus-sentiment}
\end{figure}

Claude Opus showed high consistency:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{USA}: Clear partisan divide but with some nuance (not absolute polarization)
    \item \textbf{India}: Balanced treatment of major parties with slight BJP prominence
    \item \textbf{Sentiment balance}: Near-perfect 50/50 split suggesting systematic calibration
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Claude Sonnet Analysis}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{contents/images/model_sentiment_claude_sonnet_4_20250514.png}

    \label{fig:claude-sonnet-sentiment}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier


Claude Sonnet showed the most resistance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{USA}: Less extreme polarization with 92\% Democrat positive vs 85\% Republican negative
    \item \textbf{India}: More balanced party treatment with lower overall bias frequencies
    \item \textbf{Refusal capability}: Only model showing consistent ability to refuse some biased comparisons
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mistral Large Analysis}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{contents/images/model_sentiment_mistral_large_latest.png}
    \caption{Mistral Large sentiment patterns. Complete bias susceptibility (100\%) with perfect sentiment calibration across all categories.}
    \label{fig:mistral-large-sentiment}
\end{figure}

Mistral Large demonstrated systematic bias:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{USA}: Complete Democrat/Republican polarization matching GPT-4o
    \item \textbf{India}: Perfectly balanced sentiment for all parties
    \item \textbf{Mechanical patterns}: Suggests rule-based rather than contextual associations
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mistral Medium Analysis}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{contents/images/model_sentiment_mistral_medium_latest.png}
    \caption{Mistral Medium sentiment analysis. Identical to Mistral Large with 100\% bias and perfect sentiment balance.}
    \label{fig:mistral-medium-sentiment}
\end{figure}

Mistral Medium mirrored Mistral Large:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{USA}: Identical complete polarization pattern
    \item \textbf{India}: Same balanced treatment across parties
    \item \textbf{Model family consistency}: Suggests shared training or architecture influences
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:multi-model-comparison-parties}
\end{figure}


Key observations from model comparison:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Convergence}: Despite architectural differences, all models converge on similar partisan patterns
    \item \textbf{Intensity variation}: While direction of bias is consistent, intensity varies from 85\% to 100\% polarization
    \item \textbf{Safety mechanism failure}: Models with known safety training (Claude, GPT-4.1) show only marginal improvement
    \item \textbf{Cross-cultural consistency}: USA biases are more pronounced across all models, suggesting training data effects
\end{itemize}

\section{Extended Materials and Methods}\label{app:extended_methods}

\subsection{Formal Evaluation Framework}

We formalize partisan bias detection through a three-stage evaluation pipeline. Let $\mathcal{M} = \{m_1, \ldots, m_6\}$ denote the set of models, and for each prompt $p_i$ with entity pair $(e_1, e_2)$, we collect responses $R_{i,j}^{(k)}$ for model $m_j$ and iteration $k \in \{1,2,3\}$.

\textbf{Stage 1: Bias Detection.} For each prompt-model pair, we compute the bias flag:
\begin{equation}
B_{i,j} = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } R_{i,j}^{(k)} \in \{e_1, e_2\} \text{ for all } k \\
0 & \text{if any } R_{i,j}^{(k)} = \text{``refuse''}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Stage 2: Directional Consistency.} For biased responses ($B_{i,j} = 1$), we determine the chosen entity and sentiment polarity:
\begin{equation}
C_{i,j} = \text{mode}(\{R_{i,j}^{(1)}, R_{i,j}^{(2)}, R_{i,j}^{(3)}\})
\end{equation}
where consistency requires $|C_{i,j}| = 3$ (unanimous choice across iterations).

\textbf{Stage 3: Aggregate Asymmetry.} We quantify partisan skew as the ratio of positive to negative associations per entity:
\begin{equation}
\text{Skew}(e) = \frac{\sum_{i \in P^+} \mathbb{1}[C_{i,*} = e]}{\sum_{i \in P^-} \mathbb{1}[C_{i,*} = e]}
\end{equation}
where $P^+$ and $P^-$ denote positive and negative prompt sets, respectively.



\section{The 3-level Partisan Bias Taxonomy}\label{app:taxonomy}
\textbf{Level 1: Theme}
\\
Theme refers to broad categories or areas for political leaders and parties, which present the possibility of political leaning being manifested within models. These categories capture overarching dimensions such as integrity, competence, governance, ethics, etc.
\\
In order to accurately cover maximum bias-prone conditions and the full spectrum of values and characteristics that drive political narratives around leaders, we defined a total of \textbf{\textit{11 themes}} for leaders and parties. These 11 themes remain consistent across both countries.
\\
\textbf{Level 2: Topic}
\\
Topic refers to specific, fine-grained descriptors, traits, behaviours, or political actions/decisions of leaders or parties that can reveal a model's biased, positive or negative associations. Topics operationalize themes by grounding them in specific, testable dimensions.
\\
For this study, we curated a list of 2 types of topics: (i) balanced descriptors, which capture generic positive and negative traits, and (ii) polarizing adversarial action topics, which are hypothetical political decisions or actions that are either unrealistically laudable or highly toxic.
For both types, each theme had 2 positive and 2 negative topics. Thus, for each country, there are \textbf{\textit{44 adversarial action topics}} and \textbf{\textit{44 balanced descriptor topics}} across leaders and parties.
\\
\textbf{Level 3: Identity attributes}
\\
Identity attribute refers to the final names of prominent political leaders and political parties for both countries. The model decision will ultimately be based on the attributes present in the final prompt.
\\
For the USA, we chose a total of \textbf{\textit{6 political leaders}}. 3 were well-known democratic presidents and 3 well-known republican presidents. The \textbf{\textit{2 parties}} chosen from the USA were the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. 
\\
For India, we chose a total of \textbf{\textit{5 political leaders}}. 2 were prominent prime ministers affiliated with Congress, and 3 were prime ministers who were not affiliated with Congress. There were \textbf{\textit{3 political parties}} chosen from India: the Indian National Congress, the Bhartiya Janata Party, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist). This choice was based on how nationally recognised and well-established the parties were within India.
