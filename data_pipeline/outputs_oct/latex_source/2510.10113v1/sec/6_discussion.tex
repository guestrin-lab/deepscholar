This work introduces ImmerIris, the largest public dataset to date dedicated to immersive iris recognition, capturing the intrinsic challenges of off-axis distortion, quality degradation, and intra-class variation. Through extensive benchmarks, we show that SOTAs cannot be readily transferred from controlled setups, underscoring the need for methodological advances. We propose a simple yet effective normalization-free paradigm, which achieves robust performance and points to a promising research direction.
