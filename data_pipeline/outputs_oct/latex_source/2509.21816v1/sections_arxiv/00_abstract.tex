Excel is one of the most widely used productivity tools across domains, offering rich functionality but also overwhelming users with its complexity. This creates a persistent demand for tutorials to support effective usage. However, existing tutorials are manually authored by experts, require frequent updates after each software release, and incur substantial labor costs. Prior work has not achieved fully automated tutorial generation, since existing methods still depend on handcrafted operation sequences or example materials.
In this paper, we present the first framework for automatically generating Excel tutorials directly from natural language task descriptions. Our framework first instantiates the task. Then a central component of this framework, Execution Agent, plans and executes the solution in Excel, and collects the intermediate artifacts required for tutorial construction. These artifacts are then transformed into both structured Excel documents and video demonstrations. To build a comprehensive tutorial corpus, we collected 1,559 task descriptions from real-world scenarios. In addition, we designed a systematic evaluation framework that integrates assessments from both large language models (LLMs) and human reviewers. Experimental results show that our framework improves task execution success rates by 8.5\% over state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the generated tutorials demonstrate superior readability and instructional effectiveness, often approaching or surpassing expert-authored materials. Importantly, the automated pipeline eliminates manual labor and reduces time costs to 1/20 of expert authoring, making scalable and high-quality tutorial generation practical for the first time.

% Excel is extensively adopted across diverse domains due to its rich functionality and broad user base. However, its complex and heterogeneous features often overwhelm users, creating a strong demand for tutorials as a source of support and guidance. Existing tutorials are predominantly authored by experts and require frequent manual updates following each software release, resulting in substantial labor costs. Prior research has not achieved fully automated tutorial generation, as existing approaches still rely on manually curated operation sequences and example materials. Consequently, the automatic generation of high-quality tutorials remains an open and challenging problem. In this paper, we present the first framework capable of automatically generating Excel tutorials directly from task descriptions. Our framework first instantiates the task, then plans and executes the corresponding solution while collecting the materials required for tutorial construction. Finally, these materials are transformed into both Excel documents and video tutorials. To build a comprehensive tutorial corpus, we collected 1,559 task descriptions from real-world scenarios. In addition, we designed a systematic evaluation framework that integrates assessments from both large language models (LLMs) and human reviewers. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art baselines, Excel Guide Agent improves task execution success rates by 8.5\%. In terms of tutorial quality, the generated tutorials exhibit superior readability and instructional effectiveness, approaching or even surpassing the level of expert-authored materials. Importantly, the automated process eliminates manual labor and reduces time costs to 1/20 of expert authoring.

% Excel is widely used across diverse scenarios due to its rich functionality \cz{but complex?}  and a large user base. As users face increasingly complex and diverse Excel features, Excel tutorials have become more and more important. Existing Excel tutorials \cz{rely on human?} (1) incur substantial labor costs for authoring and maintenance and (2) exhibit limited task coverage. Therefore, there is an urgent need for automated solutions to generate more comprehensive Excel tutorials with high quality and low cost. In this paper, we first formalize the task to tutorial problem, supported by a evaluation protocol and a dataset of 1,559 Excel tasks. We then introduce \textbf{Excel Guide Agent}, the first framework capable of automatically generating Excel tutorials (including help
% documents and videos) solely from task descriptions. 

% This framework enables end-to-end generation from task to tutorial via three stages: (1) instantiating tasks by matching Excel templates based on task descriptions, (2) performing solution planning and execution via a task executor, and (3) generating tutorial components and assembling them into multimodal, multi-format tutorials.
% We conducted extensive experiments on real-world Excel tasks from diverse sources, under three base model configurations (GPT-4.1, GPT-o3, GPT-5). \cz{too detailed...} Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art models, Excel Guide Agent improves task execution success rate by 8.5\%. Human and LLM evaluations confirm that our tutorials demonstrate excellent readability and instructional effectiveness, and can even surpass those written by domain experts. Furthermore, we have constructed a more comprehensive Excel tutorial library using Excel Guide Agent at low cost. \cz{Save how much effort?}
