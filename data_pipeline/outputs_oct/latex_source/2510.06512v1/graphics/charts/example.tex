LogSTOPs for three videos with respect to the query \textit{"Is there a person in all frames of this video?"}. Video 2 with occluded persons is assigned a lower score than video 1 (where a person is visible in all frames), and higher score than video 3 (where there are frames with no persons). These scores can be used for ranking and query matching with the adaptive threshold we define in Section~\ref{sec:logstop_qm}. YOLOv8x is used here to detect objects in individual frames of the videos.
