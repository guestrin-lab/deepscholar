In this paper, we studied how transfer learning can bridge the gap between simulated and real-world networks. By leveraging simulated data to complement scarce real-world network data, we explored the potential of transfer learning to build enhanced network models. Across our evaluation, we have found that using this approach has resulted in an $88\%$ and $80\%$ error reduction in flows following a Poisson and On/Off distribution, respectively. When instead replicating captured internet traffic, our approach resulted in a $48\%$ error reduction using only 50 recorded network scenarios. When only having 10 scenarios available, the error was still reduced by $37\%$. Furthermore, these benefits apply to both automated transfer learning methods and manual fine-tuning configurations. In conclusion, our approach reduces reliance on extensive real-world datasets, making it both practical and efficient, while benefiting from the strengths of network simulation.

This limitation is being explored in other fields, where research is being conducted to optimize or automate the fine-tuning process \cite{Weiss2016, 9065240}. Future work could focus on developing similar advanced techniques, specifically designed towards transfer learning-driven network modeling.}
