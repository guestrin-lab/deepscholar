Collaborative transportation of cable-suspended payloads by teams of \glspl{uav} has the potential to enhance payload capacity, adapt to different payload shapes, and provide built-in compliance, making it attractive for applications ranging from disaster relief to precision logistics. However, multi-\gls{uav} coordination under disturbances, nonlinear payload dynamics, and slack–taut cable modes remains a challenging control problem. To our knowledge, no prior work has addressed these cable mode transitions in the multi-\gls{uav} context, instead relying on simplifying rigid-link assumptions. We propose \textit{CrazyMARL}, %
a decentralized \gls{rl} framework for multi-\gls{uav} cable-suspended payload transport. Simulation results demonstrate that the learned policies can outperform classical decentralized controllers in terms of disturbance rejection and tracking precision, achieving an 80\% recovery rate from harsh conditions compared to 44\% for the baseline method. 
We also achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and demonstrate that our policies are highly robust under harsh conditions, including wind, random external disturbances, and transitions between slack and taut cable dynamics.
This work paves the way for autonomous, resilient \gls{uav} teams capable of executing complex payload missions in unstructured environments.
