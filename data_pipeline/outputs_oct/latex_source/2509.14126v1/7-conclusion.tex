\section{Conclusion}


We present a unified framework for training and deploying reinforcement learning controllers for single and multi-agent cable payload transport while taking into account hybrid cable dynamics. 
 Our end-to-end decentralized policy directly outputs motor-level PWM  commands at 250 Hz, enabling deployment on the resource-constrained Crazyflie 2.1 platform, which operates in our test scenarios near its actuation limits due to its low thrust-to-weight ratio. 
In both simulation and hardware, the approach achieves agile, robust transport, including zero-shot transfer with disturbance rejection and autonomous takeoff, capabilities that are unattainable with the baseline controller. 
These results highlight the potential of decentralized \gls{marl} with motor-level control as a scalable solution for cooperative aerial manipulation.



An interesting avenue for future research is to extend our framework to larger multi-\gls{uav} teams by adopting order-invariant peer encodings through sorting, a centralized critic, or attention-based aggregation, enabling policies that generalize across team sizes. Additionally, Integrating safety and obstacle-avoidance mechanisms would support scalable deployment in cluttered, dynamic environments.
