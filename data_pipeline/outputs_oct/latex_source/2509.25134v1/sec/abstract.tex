Designers craft and edit graphic designs in a layer representation, but layer-based editing becomes impossible once composited into a raster image. In this work, we propose \ours{}, a method to decompose raster graphic designs into layers for re-editable creative workflow. \ours{} addresses the decomposition task by iteratively extracting unoccluded foreground layers. We propose a simple yet effective refinement approach taking advantage of the assumption that layers often exhibit uniform appearance in graphic designs. As decomposition is ill-posed and the ground-truth layer structure may not be reliable, we develop a quality metric that addresses the difficulty. In experiments, we show that \ours{} successfully achieves high-quality decomposition and outperforms baselines. We also demonstrate the use of \ours{} with state-of-the-art image generators and layer-based editing. Code and models are publicly available \footnote{\url{https://cyberagentailab.github.io/LayerD/}}.
