\section{Conclusion}

We present \ours{} for decomposing raster graphic designs, where we propose the iterative extraction of unoccluded layers and background completion as well as refinement tailored for graphic materials.
We propose an evaluation protocol for the ill-posed decomposition task, where we introduce the notion of layer edit to quantify the difference from the unreliable ground truth.
The experiment showed that \ours{} led to solid improvement over baselines.

Our approach aims at decomposition, but it might be interesting to further consider vectorization~\cite{ma2022towards,song2023clipvg,carlier2020deepsvg,reddy2021im2vec}, which would expand the possible creative workflow.
In the other direction, our method could help learn a layered design generation model~\cite{jia2023cole,inoue2024opencole} as a pre-processing component, or be combined with recent automatic layered design editing~\cite{patnaik2025aesthetiqenhancinggraphiclayout,lin2024elementsdesignlayeredapproach}, or animation generation~\cite{liu2024logomotion} for interesting applications.
