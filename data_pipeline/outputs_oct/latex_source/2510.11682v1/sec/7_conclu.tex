% \section{Discussion and Limitations}


% \textbf{Limitations 1:} For long-horizon tasks such as pick and place, this method still needs demonstration.

% \textbf{Limitations 2:}
% Though \emph{value-guided surrogate loss} can potentially lower the variance of the estimation value, it generally does not preserve the local optimum of the original optimal control problem. The temporal correlation between $\hat{Q}$ along a trajectory should be calibrated in the future to have a tighter quantification of the variance reduction. 

\section{Conclusion}
By integrating a scalable ego-centric visual world model with value-guided sampling-based model predictive control, we demonstrate that humanoid robots can efficiently and robustly learn agile, contact-rich behaviors from offline, demonstration-free data, advancing data-efficient, vision-based planning for real-world robotic interaction.
