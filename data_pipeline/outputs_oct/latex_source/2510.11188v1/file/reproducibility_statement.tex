\section{Ethics statement}

This work complies with ethical standards and established research practices. All protein data were sourced from publicly available databases, with no proprietary or confidential information involved. Quality assurance and safety checks were applied to minimize harmful or inappropriate content. We acknowledge the broader risks of combining LLMs with biomolecular knowledge, including potential misuse for harmful purposes, and therefore emphasize responsible use guided by fairness, transparency, and accountability. Any harmful or unsafe applications of this dataset are strictly prohibited.

\section{Reproducibility statement}
 
We provide detailed descriptions of the protein–natural language bilingual dataset (Sec.~\ref{sec:dataset}, Appendix~\ref{appendix:dataset_detail}), the adaptive context construction mechanism (Sec.~\ref{sec:framwork}). Data processing steps and QA generation prompts for all four question types are included in Sec.~\ref{sec:dataset} and Appendix~\ref{appendix:llm_prompt}. Code implementing the framework and instructions for reproducing experiments on both frozen and protein-adapted LLMs will be provided as supplementary material upon acceptance.
