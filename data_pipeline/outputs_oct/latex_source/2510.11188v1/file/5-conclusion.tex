\section{Conclusion}

We have proposed the “\textbf{\textit{Protein-as-Second-Language}}” framework, which leverages adaptive context construction to enhance bilingual protein understanding by dynamically integrating sequence homology and textual similarity. Additionally, we introduced \textbf{\textit{a protein-natural language bilingual dataset}}, specifically designed to support this framework and facilitate the bridging of protein sequences with functional descriptions. Our approach has successfully enhanced large language models' ability to acquire protein semantics and reasoning capabilities without the need for task-specific parameter updates. Experiments on multiple protein-language datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms zero-shot baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of context-driven learning in bridging protein sequences with functional descriptions.
