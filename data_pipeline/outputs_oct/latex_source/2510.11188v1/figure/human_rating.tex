\caption{\textbf{Comparison of human evaluation results. }
Left: Absolute human rating scores (0–5) for zero-shot model outputs (dark bars) and model outputs with adaptive context exposure (light bars) on three datasets.
Right: Pairwise win/lose proportions comparing outputs with and without adaptive context exposure. Each comparison is based on 8 randomly selected cases per subset (48 cases in total across six subsets).
