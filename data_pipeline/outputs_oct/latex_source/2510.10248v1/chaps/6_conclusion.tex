\section{Conclusion}

This work introduces MPPReasoner, a novel multimodal large language model that systematically incorporates chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Through a novel two-stage training strategy combining supervised fine-tuning with RLPGR, our approach successfully bridges the gap between specialist accuracy and generalist adaptability. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvements of 20.60\% and 9.93\% on ID and OOD tasks respectively, with exceptional cross-task generalization capabilities where many specialist models lack evaluation capability. Beyond performance gains, MPPReasoner generates chemically sound reasoning paths that enable chemists to understand not just prediction outcomes but the underlying chemical rationale. This represents a crucial advancement toward interpretable AI systems that provide mechanistic insights grounded in established chemical principles, supporting informed decision-making in drug discovery and offering a potential blueprint for other scientific domains.
