\section{Conclusion and Discussion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we propose IF-V2V, a user-friendly method to perform image-conditioned video editing by leveraging the strong temporal prior of pretrained flow-based I2V models. It includes VFR-SD to achieve inversion-free editing by introducing a deviation term into the denoising vector field to preserve source video information. SMPI is used to further enhance structure and motion consistency with the source video by embedding structural information into temporally related noise. D-Cache mechanism significantly reduces the additional computational cost, making IF-V2V more practical for common users. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results across various scenarios have validated the effectiveness of IF-V2V. We believe that IF-V2V will boost the creator's community by providing a handy tool to realize their creativity. More discussions are included in \sref{sec:discussions}.

% \subsubsection*{Reproducibility Statement}
% The process of VFR-SD is detailed in \cref{alg:vfr-sd}, and all the hyperparameters of IF-V2V is listed in \sref{sec:impl}. We also discuss the theoretical justifications and hyperparameter selection criteria of IF-V2V in \sref{sec:discussions}. Our code will be made publicly available to facilitate relevant research.
