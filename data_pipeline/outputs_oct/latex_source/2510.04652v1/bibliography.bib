This paper is the first attempt to investigate reasoning in reified I/O logic, specifically compliance checking.

@article{Piryani2023,
   abstract = {In the literature, the notion of an event is ubiquitous. An event can be defined as a specific occurrence of something (action or series of action) that happens in a certain time, a certain place, due to certain reasons, involving one or more participants (such as objects, humans) and can frequently be described as a change of state. Formally it can be represented as a hexa-tuple: e = 〈What, Where, When, Who, Why, How〉. The elements of hexa-tuple are called event elements, that respectively describe What: change and action, When: specific time, Where: possible place, Who: active/passive entities Why: possible reason of cause and How: method by which an action was performed. This overview examines how existing ontologies represent an event and how they handle the representation of its 5W1H characteristics elements. The intent is not to present the ontologies fully in detail as overviews already exist, but rather to help to choose the ontology that will cover specific requirements based on the characteristics elements of an event that need to be represented. Furthermore, we are presenting the ideas how to represent 5W1H event constituents by creating a new event ontology.},

   abstract = {Reification of propositions expressing states, events, and properties has been widely advocated as a means of handling temporal reasoning in AI. The author proposes that such reification is both philosophically suspect and technically unneces- sary. The reified theories of Allen and Shoham are examined and it is shown how they can be unreified. The resulting loss of expressive power can be rectified by adopting Davidson's theory in which event tokens, rather than event types, are reified. This pro- cedure is illustrated by means of Kowalski and Ser- got's Event Calculus, the additional type-reification of the latter system being excised by means of a general procedure proposed by the author for converting type-reification into token-reification. Some examples are given to demonstrate the expressive power of the resulting theory.},

@article{Vila1996,
   abstract = {The approach to temporal reasoning which has proven most popular in AI is the reified approach. In this approach, one introduces names for events and states and uses special predicates to assert that an event or state occurs or holds at a particular time. However, recently the reified approach has come under attack, both on technical and on ontological grounds. Thus, it has been claimed that at least some reified temporal logics do not give one more expressive power than provided by alternative approaches. Moreover, it has been argued that the reification of event and state types in reified temporal logics, rather than event and state tokens, makes the ontology more complicated than necessary. In this paper, we present a new reified temporal logic, called TRL, which we believe avoids most of these objections. It is based on the idea of reifying event tokens instead of event types. However, unlike other such attempts, our logic contains "meaningful" names for event tokens, thus allowing us to quantify over all event tokens that meet a certain criterion. The resulting logic is more expressive than alternative approaches. Moreover, it avoids the ontologically objectionable reification of event types, while staying within classical first-order predicate logic.},

The latter is a wide-coverage logic for Natural Language Semantics (NLS) able to handle a fairly large set of linguistic phenomena into a simple logical formalism. The result is a new framework that we will call ‘reified Input/Output logic’. This article represents the first step of a long-term research aiming at filling the gap between Input/Output logic and the richness of NLS. We plan in our future work to use reified Input/Output logic as the underlying formalism for applications in legal informatics to process and reason on existing legal texts, which are available in natural language only.},

   abstract = {The popularity of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) both in industry and academia owes credit to their flexible data model, suitable for data integration from multiple sources. Several KG-based applications such as trust assessment or view maintenance on dynamic data rely on the ability to compute provenance explanations for query results. The how-provenance of a query result is an expression that encodes the records (triples or facts) that explain its inclusion in the result set. This article proposes NPCS, a Native Provenance Computation approach for SPARQL queries. NPCS annotates query results with their how-provenance. By building upon spm-provenance semirings, NPCS supports both monotonic and non-monotonic SPARQL queries. Thanks to its reliance on query rewriting techniques, the approach is directly applicable to already deployed SPARQL engines using different reification schemes - including RDF-star. Our experimental evaluation on two popular SPARQL engines (GraphDB and Stardog) shows that our novel query rewriting brings a significant runtime improvement over existing query rewriting solutions, scaling to RDF graphs with billions of triples.},

@article{Knez2023,
   abstract = {Textual documents serve as representations of discussions on a variety of subjects. These discussions can vary in length and may encompass a range of events or factual information. Present trends in constructing knowledge bases primarily emphasize fact-based common sense reasoning, often overlooking the temporal dimension of events. Given the widespread presence of time-related information, addressing this temporal aspect could potentially enhance the quality of common-sense reasoning within existing knowledge graphs. In this comprehensive survey, we aim to identify and evaluate the key tasks involved in constructing temporal knowledge graphs centered around events. These tasks can be categorized into three main components: (a) event extraction, (b) the extraction of temporal relationships and attributes, and (c) the creation of event-based knowledge graphs and timelines. Our systematic review focuses on the examination of available datasets and language technologies for addressing these tasks. An in-depth comparison of various approaches reveals that the most promising results are achieved by employing state-of-the-art models leveraging large pre-trained language models. Despite the existence of multiple datasets, a noticeable gap exists in the availability of annotated data that could facilitate the development of comprehensive end-to-end models. Drawing insights from our findings, we engage in a discussion and propose four future directions for research in this domain. These directions encompass (a) the integration of pre-existing knowledge, (b) the development of end-to-end systems for constructing event-centric knowledge graphs, (c) the enhancement of knowledge graphs with event-centric information, and (d) the prediction of absolute temporal attributes.},
