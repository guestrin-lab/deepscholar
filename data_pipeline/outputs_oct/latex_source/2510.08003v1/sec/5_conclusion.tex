\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we presented \textbf{CIR-CoT}, a framework that leverages chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance image retrieval from natural language queries. CIR-CoT performs explicit reasoning and generates interpretable intermediate descriptions before final retrieval. Experiments on various CIR datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance and strong cross-domain adaptability. Qualitative results further show that CIR-CoT can infer user intent and articulate target image descriptions, surpassing traditional CIR methods. This work paves the way for integrating reasoning into multimodal retrieval and provides a foundation for developing more interpretable CIR systems.
