\section{Introduction}
\label{sec_supp_intro}
We first provide additional details of our method, including parameter settings and further descriptions, in Sec.~\ref{sec_add_detail}. Then, we present extended experimental results in Sec.~\ref{sec_add_exp}. In Sec.~\ref{sec_add_discussion}, we conduct deeper analyses on entropy in relation to model behavior and image content, along with more visualizations of entropy maps. Sec.~\ref{sec_supp_conclusion} discusses potential limitations and future directions. Lastly, we include more visual comparisons of the proposed method in Sec.~\ref{sec_add_visual_comparison}.
