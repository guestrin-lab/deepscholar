\section{Conclusion}
\mmore{} is a scalable, open-source pipeline for retrieval-augmented generation over diverse, real-world data. It supports more than 15 file types, including PDFs, spreadsheets, images, audio, and video, and enables structured, high-throughput integration into LLM workflows.

Our results show that \mmore{} outperforms \textit{Docling} in both speed and layout fidelity, particularly in OCR-heavy documents, and improves biomedical QA accuracy on PubMedQA via efficient RAG pipelines.

Built for extensibility and deployment at scale, \mmore{} provides a flexible foundation for verifiable, multimodal LLM applications. Future work will expand support for multilingual retrieval, audiovisual alignment, and federated processing in privacy-sensitive settings.
