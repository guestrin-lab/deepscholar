abstract = {Collecting data is one of the bottlenecks of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. Motivated by this, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) in generating synthetic user research data. We use OpenAI’s GPT-3 model to generate open-ended questionnaire responses about experiencing video games as art, a topic not tractable with traditional computational user models. We test whether synthetic responses can be distinguished from real responses, analyze errors of synthetic data, and investigate content similarities between synthetic and real data. We conclude that GPT-3 can, in this context, yield believable accounts of HCI experiences. Given the low cost and high speed of LLM data generation, synthetic data should be useful in ideating and piloting new experiments, although any findings must obviously always be validated with real data. The results also raise concerns: if employed by malicious users of crowdsourcing services, LLMs may make crowdsourcing of self-report data fundamentally unreliable.},

abstract = {The conflict between the rapid iteration demand of prototyping and the time-consuming nature of user tests has led researchers to adopt AI methods to identify usability issues. However, these AI-driven methods concentrate on evaluating the feasibility of a system, while often overlooking the influence of specified user characteristics and usage contexts. Our work proposes a tool named SimUser based on large language models (LLMs) with the Chain-of-Thought structure and user modeling method. It generates usability feedback by simulating the interaction between users and applications, which is influenced by user characteristics and contextual factors. The empirical study (48 human users and 21 designers) validated that in the context of a simple smartwatch interface, SimUser could generate heuristic usability feedback with the similarity varying from 35.7\% to 100\% according to the user groups and usability category. Our work provides insights into simulating users by LLM to improve future design activities.},

abstract = {Usability testing is vital for enhancing the user experience (UX) of interactive systems. However, analyzing test videos is complex and resource-intensive. Recent AI advancements have spurred exploration into human-AI collaboration for UX analysis, particularly through natural language. Unlike user-initiated dialogue, our study investigated the potential of proactive conversational assistants to aid UX evaluators through automatic suggestions at three distinct times: before, in sync with, and after potential usability problems. We conducted a hybrid Wizard-of-Oz study involving 24 UX evaluators, using ChatGPT to generate automatic problem suggestions and a human actor to respond to impromptu questions. While timing did not significantly impact analytic performance, suggestions appearing after potential problems were preferred, enhancing trust and efficiency. Participants found the automatic suggestions useful, but they collectively identified more than twice as many problems, underscoring the irreplaceable role of human expertise. Our findings also offer insights into future human-AI collaborative tools for UX evaluation.},
