\begin{abstract}
To tap into the growing market of cloud gaming, whereby game graphics is rendered in the cloud and streamed back to the user as a video feed, network operators are creating monetizable assurance services that dynamically provision network resources. However, without accurately measuring cloud gaming user experience, they cannot assess the effectiveness of their provisioning methods. Basic measures such as bandwidth and frame rate by themselves do not suffice, and can only be interpreted in the context of the game played and the player activity within the game.
This paper equips the network operator with a method to obtain a real-time measure of cloud gaming experience by analyzing network traffic, including contextual factors such as the game title and player activity stage. Our method is able to classify the game title within the first five seconds of game launch, and continuously assess the player activity stage as being active, passive, or idle. We deploy it in an ISP hosting NVIDIA cloud gaming servers for the region. We provide insights from hundreds of thousands of cloud game streaming sessions over a three-month period into the dependence of bandwidth consumption and experience level on the gameplay contexts.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have developed a real-time network traffic analysis method that classifies the gameplay contexts of cloud game streaming sessions for network operators to effectively measure the user experience of this emerging application that exhibits high demands on network resources. We first systematically analyze unique network traffic characteristics of cloud game streaming sessions across various gameplay contexts, including packet group profiles for different game titles and flow volumetric behaviors for player activity stages. Driven by these insights, our real-time network traffic analysis method is developed with two novel processes leveraging machine learning models to classify game titles during the game launching stage and continuously measure player activity stages, respectively.
Our classification method is implemented in the network observability platform operated for an ISP hosting NVIDIA's cloud gaming servers with representative insights over a three-month period discussed. By integrating with the existing QoE and QoS metrics of cloud gaming sessions, our method helps the ISP significantly reduce the instances of poor user experience in cloud gameplay that are incorrectly labeled due to less demanding game titles and inactive player activity stages.
