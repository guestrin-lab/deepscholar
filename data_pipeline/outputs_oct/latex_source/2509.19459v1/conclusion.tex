\section{Conclusion\label{sec:conc}}

Correctly using flush and fence operations is notoriously hard.   \Tool employs  compiler analysis and transformation to automatically insert flush and fence instructions, providing strong persistency via robustness, a sufficient condition for the correct usage of flush and fence operations in PM programs.  \Tool ensures the absence of flush and fence bugs and eliminates the time-consuming and error-prone task of manually inserting these operations.
